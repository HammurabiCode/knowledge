<div class="intro">
    <p>An innovative, groundbreaking book that will captivate readers of Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, The Power of Habit, and Quiet</p>    <p>For generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But today, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly, givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return.</p>    <p>Using his own pioneering research as Wharton&#39;s youngest tenured professor, Grant (author of Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World) shows that these styles have a surprising impact on success. Although some givers get exploited and burn out, the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories, this landmark book shows how one of America&#39;s best networkers developed his connections, why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity, how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner, and how we could have anticipated Enron&#39;s demise four years before the company collapsed-without ever looking at a single number.</p>    <p>Praised by bestselling authors such as Dan Pink, Tony Hsieh, Dan Ariely, Susan Cain, Dan Gilbert, Gretchen Rubin, Bob Sutton, David Allen, Robert Cialdini, and Seth Godin-as well as senior leaders from Google, McKinsey, Merck, Estee Lauder, Nike, and NASA-Give and Take highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common. This landmark book opens up an approach to success that has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organizations and communities.</p></div>

                1. As Samuel Johnson purportedly wrote, “The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2. Research shows that as people gain power, they feel large and in charge: less constrained and freer to express their natural tendencies. As takers gain power, they pay less attention to how they’re perceived by those below and next to them; they feel entitled to pursue self-serving goals and claim as much value as they can. Over time, treating peers and subordinates poorly jeopardizes their relationships and reputations<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3. After all, most people are matchers: their core values emphasize fairness, equality, and reciprocity. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>4. In networks, new research shows that when people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational information. “Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment,” write the social scientists Matthew Feinberg, Joey Cheng, and Robb Willer. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>5. As Wayne Baker, a University of Michigan sociologist and networking expert, explains, “If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from investments in meaningful activities and relationships.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>6. Since takers tend to be self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and myself—versus first-person plural pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>7. Another signal was compensation: the taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives in their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>8. For the taker CEOs, it was all about me. A big photo is self-glorifying, sending a clear message: “I am the central figure in this company.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>9. Tiny cues like words and photos can reveal profound clues about us, and research suggests that ordinary people can identify takers just by looking at their Facebook profiles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>10. The takers posted information that was rated as more self-promoting, self-absorbed, and self-important. They featured quotes that were evaluated as boastful and arrogant. The takers also had significantly more Facebook friends, racking up superficial connections so they could advertise their accomplishments and stay in touch to get favors, and posted vainer, more flattering pictures of themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>11. Rifkin reflects. “You never know where somebody’s going to end up. It’s not just about building your reputation; it really is about being there for other people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>12. The fact that Rifkin gives a lot more than he receives is a key point: takers and matchers also give in the context of networks, but they tend to give strategically, with an expected personal return that exceeds or equals their contributions. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>13. At its core, the giver approach extends a broader reach, and in doing so enlarges the range of potential payoffs, even though those payoffs are not the motivating engine.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>14. One of Rifkin’s maxims is “I believe in the strength of weak ties.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>15. But surprisingly, people were significantly more likely to benefit from weak ties. Almost 28 percent heard about the job from a weak tie. Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>16. The key is reconnecting, and it’s a major reason why givers succeed in the long run<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>17. Rifkin’s experience sheds new light on the old saying that what goes around comes around. These karmic moments can often be traced to the fact that matchers are on a mission to make them happen. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>18. His secret was deceptively simple: he asked thoughtful questions and listened with remarkable patience.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>19. The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>20. As Levin and colleagues explain, “reconnecting a dormant relationship is not like starting a relationship from scratch. When people reconnect, they still have feelings of trust.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>21. According to networking experts, reconnecting is a totally different experience for givers, especially in a wired world. Givers have a track record of generously sharing their knowledge, teaching us their skills, and helping us find jobs without worrying about what’s in it for them, so we’re glad to help them when they get back in touch with us.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>22. The takers were black holes. They sucked the energy from those around them. The givers were suns: they injected light around the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements. When they disagreed with suggestions, givers showed respect for the people who spoke up, rather than belittling them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>23. “I have always been a very genuine and kind-hearted person,” Stephanie says, “but I had tried to hide it and be more competitive so that I could get ahead. The important lesson I learned from Adam is that you can be a genuinely kind-hearted person and still get ahead in the world.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>24. By creating a norm of adding value, Rifkin transforms giving from a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>25.Giving, especially when it’s distinctive and consistent, establishes a pattern that shifts other people’s reciprocity styles within a group. It turns out that giving can be contagious. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>26. Since you can’t communicate with one another, giving is a risky strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>27. The more generous they were, the more respect and prestige they earned from their colleagues. Through giving more than they got, givers signaled their unique skills, demonstrated their value, and displayed their good intentions.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>28. Of all engineers, the most productive were those who gave often—and gave more than they received. These were the true givers, and they had the highest productivity and the highest status: they were revered by their peers. By giving often, engineers built up more trust and attracted more valuable help from across their work groups—not just from the people they helped.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>29. “I’ll sum up the key to success in one word: generosity,” writes Keith Ferrazzi. “If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>30. Geniuses tend to be takers: to promote their own interests, they “drain intelligence, energy, and capability” from others. Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their “intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities” of other people, Wiseman writes, such that “lightbulbs go off over people’s heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>31. The star investment analysts and the cardiac surgeons depended heavily on collaborators who knew them well or had strong skills of their own. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>32. Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak. Givers are more likely to see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness the skills of multiple people for a greater good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>33. Meyer summarizes his code of honor as “(1) Show up. (2) Work hard. (3) Be kind. (4) Take the high road.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>34. when people act generously in groups, they earn idiosyncrasy credits—positive impressions that accumulate in the minds of group members.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>35. Givers like Meyer do this naturally: they take care to recognize what other people contribute. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>36. “I tried to create a climate in the room where everybody feels that they can contribute, that it’s okay to fall on your face many, many times,” he says. This is known as psychological safety—the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>37. This is a perspective gap: when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>38. In collaborations, takers rarely cross this perspective gap. They’re so focused on their own viewpoints that they never end up seeing how others are reacting to their ideas and feedback. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>39. When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>40. The bloomers weren’t any smarter than their peers—the difference “was in the mind of the teacher.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>41. Teachers’ beliefs created self-fulfilling prophecies. When teachers believed their students were bloomers, they set high expectations for their success. As a result, the teachers engaged in more supportive behaviors that boosted the students’ confidence and enhanced their learning and development. Teachers communicated more warmly to the bloomers, gave them more challenging assignments.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>42. Overall, when managers were randomly assigned to see employees as bloomers, employees bloomed. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>43. Givers don’t wait for signs of potential. Because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people’s intentions, in their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone. By default, givers start by viewing people as bloomers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>44. Your husband, family, and friends love you because of the beautiful person you have made yourself—not because of a performance on an examination. Success doesn’t measure a human being, effort does.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>45. Today, we have compelling evidence that interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>46. By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>47. The psychologist Angela Duckworth calls this grit: having passion and perseverance toward long-term goals. Her research shows that above and beyond intelligence and aptitude, gritty people—by virtue of their interest, focus, and drive—achieve higher performance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>48. One of the keys to cultivating grit is making the task at hand more interesting and motivating.In Bloom’s study, across the board, the talented musicians and athletes were initially taught by givers, teachers who liked children and rewarded them with praise, signs of approval, or even candy when they did anything right. They were extremely encouraging. They were enthusiastic about the talent field and what they had to teach these children. In many cases... they treated the child as a friend of the family might. Perhaps the major quality of these teachers was that they made the initial learning very pleasant and rewarding.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>49. It turns out that givers are the least vulnerable to the mistake of overinvesting in people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>50. The givers, on the other hand, were primarily concerned about protecting other people and the organization, so they were more willing to admit their initial mistakes and de-escalate their commitment.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>51. Other studies show that people actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they’re choosing on behalf of others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>52. When Inman saw a guy practice with grit and play like a giver, he classified him as a diamond in the rough. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>53. In my own research, I’ve found that because of their dedication to others, givers are willing to work harder and longer than takers and matchers. Even when practice is no longer enjoyable, givers continue exerting effort out of a sense of responsibility to their team.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>54. Takers are attracted to, and excel in, gaining dominance. In an effort to claim as much value as possible, they strive to be superior to others. To establish dominance, takers specialize in powerful communication: they speak forcefully, raise their voices to assert their authority, express certainty to project confidence, promote their accomplishments, and sell with conviction and pride. They display strength by spreading their arms in dominant poses, raising their eyebrows in challenge, commanding as much physical space as possible, and conveying anger and issuing threats when necessary. In the quest for influence, takers set the tone and control the conversation by sending powerful verbal and nonverbal signals. As a result, takers tend to be much more effective than givers in gaining dominance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>55. The opposite of a taker’s powerful communication style is called powerless communication. Powerless communicators tend to speak less assertively, expressing plenty of doubt and relying heavily on advice from others. They talk in ways that signal vulnerability, revealing their weaknesses and making use of disclaimers, hedges, and hesitations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>56. In my role as a professor, I’ve always felt a strong sense of responsibility to give to my students, and I tend to be more concerned about connecting with students than establishing my authority. When I teach undergraduates, I open my very first class with a story about my biggest failures.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>57.  Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they’re interested in helping others, not gaining power over them, so they’re not afraid of exposing chinks in their armor. By making themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>58. expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker’s competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>59. Psychologists call this the pratfall effect. Spilling a cup of coffee hurt the image of the average candidate: it was just another reason for the audience to dislike him. But the same blunder helped the expert appear human and approachable—instead of superior and distant.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>60. It’s the givers, by virtue of their interest in getting to know us, who ask us the questions that enable us to experience the joy of learning from ourselves. And by giving us the floor, givers are actually learning about us and from us, which helps them figure out how to sell us things we already value.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>61. My job is to take the patient, ask the patient questions, and see what the patient needs. My mind-set is not to sell. My job is to help. My main purpose is to educate and inform patients on what’s important. My true concern in the long run is that the patient can see.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>62. He identified expert negotiators as those who were rated as highly effective by both sides, and had a strong track record of success with few failures. The expert negotiators spent much more time trying to understand the other side’s perspective.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>63. Takers tend to use powerful speech: they’re assertive and direct. Givers tend to use more powerless speech, talking with tentative markers like these.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>64.  Takers, the study’s authors report, “attain influence because they behave in ways that make them appear competent—even when they actually lack competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>65. Speaking dominantly convinces group members that takers are powerful, but it stifles information sharing, preventing members from communicating good ideas. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>66. New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>67. flattery only worked when it was coupled with advice seeking.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>68.  research shows that people who regularly seek advice and help from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by supervisors than those who never seek advice and help.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>69. Appearing vulnerable doesn’t bother givers, who worry far less about protecting their egos and projecting certainty. When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning from others. Matchers hold back on advice seeking for a different reason: they might owe something in return.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>70. He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>71. Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice. Giving advice makes takers feel important, and it makes givers feel helpful.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>72. When presenting, givers make it clear that they’re expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>73. The intelligent altruists, though less altruistic than the unintelligent altruists, will be fitter than both unintelligent altruists and selfish individuals.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>74. Success involves more than just capitalizing on the strengths of giving; it also requires avoiding the pitfalls. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>75.  The successful givers weren’t just more other-oriented than their peers; they were also more self-interested. Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>76.  Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>77. I’ve consistently found that self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>78. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>79. Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>80. across occupational sectors, teaching has the highest rates of emotional exhaustion.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>81. Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>82. Having a greater impact is one of the reasons why, counterintuitive as it might seem, giving more can actually help givers avoid burnout. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>83. Rather, “the change of context brought renewed energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>84. In one study, people who maintained equilibrium between benefiting themselves and others even achieved significant increases in happiness and life satisfaction over a six-month period.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>85. Chunking giving is an otherish strategy. In contrast, selfless givers are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping whenever people need them. This can become highly distracting and exhausting, robbing selfless givers of the attention and energy necessary to complete their own work.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>86. This is the 100-hour rule of volunteering. It appears to be the range where giving is maximally energizing and minimally draining.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>87. Research shows that if people start volunteering two hours a week, their happiness, satisfaction, and self-esteem go up a year later. Two hours a week in a fresh domain appears to be the sweet spot where people make a meaningful difference without being overwhelmed or sacrificing other priorities. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>88.  Giving has an energizing effect only if it’s an enjoyable, meaningful choice rather than undertaken out of duty and obligation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>89. But the reasons for giving mattered immensely: on days that people helped others out of a sense of enjoyment and purpose, they experienced significant gains in energy.* Giving for these reasons conferred a greater sense of autonomy, mastery, and connection to others, and it boosted their energy. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>90. Selfless givers are determined to be in the helper role, so they’re reluctant to burden or inconvenience others.In contrast, otherish givers recognize the importance of protecting their own well-being. When they’re on the brink of burnout, otherish givers seek help, which enables them to marshal the advice, assistance, and resources necessary to maintain their motivation and energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>91. Otherish givers build up a support network that they can access for help when they need it. This, along with chunking giving so that it’s energizing, is what makes otherish givers less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>92. although matchers and takers appear to be less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers, the greatest resilience may belong to otherish givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>93.  givers accrue an advantage in controlling their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Over time, giving may build willpower like weight lifting builds muscles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>94. Giving actually seemed to make people richer.Surprising as it seems, people who give more go on to earn more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>95. If you spend the money on yourself, your happiness doesn’t change. But if you spend the money on others, you actually report becoming significantly happier. This is otherish giving: you get to choose who you help, and it benefits you by improving your mood.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>96. giving actually activates the reward and meaning centers in our brains, which send us pleasure and purpose signals when we act for the benefit of others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>97. meaningfulness was associated with being a giver more than a taker.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>98. Overall, on average, happier people earn more money, get higher performance ratings, make better decisions, negotiate sweeter deals, and contribute more to their organizations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>99. otherish employees made more sustainable contributions than the selfless givers, takers, or matchers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>100. Ironically, because concern for their own interests sustains their energy, otherish givers actually give more than selfless givers.Otherish givers may appear less altruistic than selfless givers, but their resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>101. Becoming a doormat is the giver’s worst nightmare, and I’ll make the case that an otherish approach enables givers to escape the trap of being too trusting by becoming highly flexible and adaptable in their reciprocity styles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>102. I’ll also argue that an otherish style helps givers sidestep the land mines of being too empathetic and too timid by repurposing some skills that come naturally to them。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>103. Trust is one reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is trustworthy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>104. To avoid getting scammed or exploited, it’s critical to distinguish the genuine givers from the takers and fakers. Successful givers need to know who’s likely to manipulate them so that they can protect themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>105.  Giving and taking are based on our motives and values, and they’re choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. “Whether you’re nice or not nice is separate from whether you’re self-focused or other-focused. They’re independent, not opposites.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. We often overlook that there are disagreeable givers: people who are rough and tough in demeanor, but ultimately generous with their time, expertise, and connections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>107. The ability to recognize agreeable takers as fakers is what protects givers against being exploited. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>108. Although they don’t always put their skills to good use, givers have an instinctive advantage in sincerity screening. Research suggests that in general, givers are more accurate judges of others than matchers and takers. Givers are more attentive to others’ behaviors and more attuned to their thoughts and feelings, which makes it possible to pick up more clues—such as describing successes with first-person singular pronouns, like I and me instead of us and we. Givers also gain a sincerity screening advantage from habitually trusting others, which creates opportunities to see the wide range of behaviors of which other people are capable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>109. Over time, givers become sensitive to individual differences and shades of gray between the black-and-white boxes of agreeable and disagreeable.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>110. Once givers start to use their skills in sincerity screening to identify potential takers, they know when to put up their guard.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>111. Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it’s also a major source of vulnerability.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>112. As with the dating couples in love, empathy had turned Peter into a doormat—until he discovered an alternative to empathy that’s equally aligned with his natural strengths as a giver. Instead of contemplating Rich’s feelings, Peter considered what Rich was thinking. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>113. Studies led by Columbia psychologist Adam Galinsky show that when we empathize at the bargaining table, focusing on our counterparts’ emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much. But when we engage in perspective taking, considering our counterparts’ thoughts and interests, we’re more likely to find ways to make deals that satisfy our counterparts without sacrificing our own interests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>114. Once successful givers see the value of sincerity screening and begin to spot agreeable takers as potential fakers, they protect themselves by adjusting their behavior accordingly.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>115.  It’s wise to start out as a giver, since research shows that trust is hard to build but easy to destroy. But once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their reciprocity styles and shift to a matching strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>116. The takers acted competitively regardless of who their partners were. The rest adapted to their partners; they were cooperative when working with cooperative partners, but once a partner was competitive, they matched their behavior, responding in a more competitive manner. Game theorists call this tit for tat, and it’s a pure matcher strategy: start out cooperating, and stay cooperative unless your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, match the behavior by competing too. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>117. In generous tit for tat, the rule is “never forget a good turn, but occasionally forgive a bad one.”You start out cooperating and continue cooperating until your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, instead of always responding competitively, generous tit for tat usually means competing two thirds of the time, acting cooperatively in response to one of every three defections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>118. Being otherish means that givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror, taking care to trust but verify. When dealing with takers, shifting into matcher mode is a self-protective strategy. But one out of every three times, it may be wise to shift back into giver mode, granting so-called takers the opportunity to redeem themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>119. The men and women were equally qualified, but the men were earning substantially more money. Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, stared at the data in dismay. Although it was the twenty-first century, the male MBA graduates from her school had 7.6 percent higher salaries than their female counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>120. More than half of the men—57 percent—tried to negotiate their starting salaries, compared with only 7 percent of the women. The men were more than eight times as likely to negotiate as the women.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>121. Research shows that one of the main reasons that women tend to negotiate less assertively than men is that they worry about violating social expectations that they’ll be warm and kind.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>122. male executives landed the same salaries regardless of whether they were negotiating for themselves or others, whereas female executives did much better when negotiating for others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>123. Advocating for others was the key to Sameer’s chump change.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>124. By asking on behalf of his family, instead of himself, Sameer was maintaining an image as a giver. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>125. by offering relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they present themselves as agents advocating for others, which is a powerful way to maintain their self-images and social images as givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>126. The most effective negotiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts’ interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>127. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, otherish givers are able to think in more complex ways and identify win-win solutions that both takers and selfless givers miss. Instead of just giving away value like selfless givers, otherish givers create value first. By the time they give slices of pie away, the entire pie is big enough that there’s plenty left to claim for themselves: they can give more and take more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>128. Geller engaged others in sharing the workload, creating opportunities for them to become givers, while keeping himself from becoming overloaded.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>129. “If you have a natural mix of givers, takers, and matchers in your company,” Bauer says, “you can do a lot to magnify the giver tendency, suppress the more aggressive taker tendencies, and shift the matchers toward giving. There’s an energy and a satisfaction that you get out of it. In its own way, it’s addictive.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>130. Although many successful givers start from the default of trusting others’ intentions, they’re also careful to scan their environments to screen for potential takers, always ready to shift from feeling a taker’s emotions to analyzing a taker’s thoughts, and flex from giving unconditionally to a more measured approach of generous tit for tat. And when they feel inclined to back down, successful givers are prepared to draw reserves of assertiveness from their commitments to the people who matter to them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>131. If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they’re more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>132. He argued that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we experience a sense of oneness with the victim. We merge the victim into our sense of self. We see more of ourselves in the victim.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>133. Empathy leads to a sense of oneness, or self-other overlap, and this leads to greater helping.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>134.  Oneness is otherish. Most of the time that we give, it’s based on a cocktail of mixed motives to benefit others and ourselves. Takers and matchers may be most likely to give when they feel they can advance others’ interests and their own at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>135. For many volunteers, writing Wikipedia entries is otherish: it provides personal enjoyment and benefits others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>136.  It’s noteworthy that Freecycle’s formal mission statement highlights two sets of benefits: members can contribute to others and gain for themselves. The mission is to “build a worldwide gifting movement that reduces waste, saves precious resources &amp; eases the burden on our landfills while enabling our members to benefit from the strength of a larger community.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>137. Brewer calls it the principle of optimal distinctiveness: we look for ways to fit in and stand out.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>138. A popular way to achieve optimal distinctiveness is to join a unique group. Being part of a group with shared interests, identities, goals, values, skills, characteristics, or experiences gives us a sense of connection and belonging. At the same time, being part of a group that is clearly distinct from other groups gives us a sense of uniqueness. Studies show that people identify more strongly with individuals and groups that share unique similarities. The more rare a group, value, interest, skill, or experience is, the more likely it is to facilitate a bond.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>139. Knowing that other people were conserving energy was the best way to get residents to follow suit.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>140. Legitimizing small contributions draws in takers, making it difficult and embarrassing for them to say no, without dramatically reducing the amount donated by givers。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>141. When people join a group, they look for cues about appropriate behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>142. As Charles Darwin once wrote, a tribe with many people acting like givers, who “were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>143. Workplaces and schools are often designed to be zero-sum environments, with forced rankings and required grading curves that pit group members against one another in win-lose contests. In these settings, it’s only natural to assume that peers will lean in the taker direction, so people hold back on giving.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>144. In my experience, this is what happens in many businesses and universities: plenty of people hold giver values, but suppress or disguise them under the mistaken assumption that their peers don’t share these values. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>145. Of all the giving exchanges that occurred, roughly 90 percent were initiated by the recipient asking for help. Yet when we have a need, we’re often reluctant to ask for help. Much of the time, we’re embarrassed: we don’t want to look incompetent or needy, and we don’t want to burden others. As one Wharton dean explains, “The students call it Game Face: they feel pressured to look successful all the time. There can’t be any chinks in their armor, and opening up would make them vulnerable.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>146. In the Reciprocity Ring, because everyone is making a request, there’s little reason to be embarrassed. By making requests explicit and specific, participants provide potential givers with clear direction about how to contribute effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>147. Takers know that in a public setting, they’ll gain reputational benefits for being generous in sharing their knowledge, resources, and connections. If they don’t contribute, they look stingy and selfish, and they won’t get much help with their own requests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>148. Research shows that givers usually contribute regardless of whether it’s public or private, but takers are more likely to contribute when it’s public. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>149. By making contributions visible, the Reciprocity Ring sets up an opportunity for people of any reciprocity style to be otherish: they can do good and look good at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>150. This raises a fundamental question: does a generalized giving system like Freecycle or the Reciprocity Ring motivate takers to become better fakers, or can it actually turn takers into givers? In some ways, I’d say the motives don’t matter: it’s the behavior itself that counts. If takers are acting in ways that benefit others, even if the motives are primarily selfish rather than selfless or otherish, they’re making contributions that sustain generalized giving as a form of exchange.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>151. In a series of experiments led by NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, people who went public with their intentions to engage in an identity-relevant behavior were significantly less likely to engage in the behavior than people who kept their intentions private. When people made their identity plans known to others, they were able to claim the identity without actually following through on the behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>152. But even then, evidence suggests that privately signing a kindness pledge might backfire. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>153. Influence is far more powerful in the opposite direction: change people’s behaviors first, and their attitudes often follow.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>154. Research documents a similar process inside companies: as people make voluntary decisions to help colleagues and customers beyond the scope of their jobs, they come to see themselves as organizational citizens.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>155. Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return... after helping others... They just go on to something else... We should be like that.—Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>156. The brightest negotiators got better deals for their counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>157. “The smarter negotiator appears to be able to understand his or her opponents’ true interests and thus to provide them with better deals at little cost to him- or herself,” Barry and Friedman write. The more intelligent you are, the more you help your counterpart succeed.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>158. In the mind of a giver, the definition of success itself takes on a distinctive meaning. Whereas takers view success as attaining results that are superior to others’ and matchers see success in terms of balancing individual accomplishments with fairness to others, givers are inclined to follow Peter’s lead, characterizing success as individual achievements that have a positive impact on others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>159. This is what I find most magnetic about successful givers: they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>160. He asked them what they would enjoy doing that might also be of interest to other people. He inquired about their hobbies and personal interests, and what they would love to spend more time doing at the company. He then sent them out into the company to pursue their mission with three rules: it has to (1) appeal to at least one other person, (2) be low or no cost, and (3) be initiated by you.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>161. Job crafting involves innovating around a job description, creatively adding and customizing tasks and responsibilities to match personal interests and values.it involves creating a “before sketch” of how you currently allocate your time and energy, and then developing a visual “after diagram” of how you’d like to modify your job.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>162. A fascinating approach called the Love Machine was developed at Linden Lab, the company behind the virtual world Second Life. In a high-technology company, many employees aim to protect their time for themselves and guard information closely, instead of sharing their time and knowledge with colleagues. The Love Machine was designed to overcome this tendency by enabling employees to send a Love message when they appreciated help from a colleague. The Love messages were visible to others, rewarding and recognizing giving by linking it to status and reputations. One insider viewed it as a way to get “tech geeks to compete to see who could be the most helpful.” Love helped to “boost awareness of people who did tasks that were sometimes overlooked. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>163. “The more you give, the more you want to do it—as do others around you. It’s like going to the gym,” Nipun says. “If you’ve been working out your kindness muscles, you get stronger at it.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>164. Actions for impact<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        1. Test Your Giver Quotient. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        2. Run a Reciprocity Ring.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        3. Help Other People Craft Their Jobs—or Craft Yours to Incorporate More Giving.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        4. Start a Love Machine. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        5. Embrace the Five-Minute Favor.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        6. Practice Powerless Communication, but Become an Advocate.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        7. Join a Community of Givers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        8. Launch a Personal Generosity Experiment.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        9. Help Fund a Project. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        10. Seek Help More Often.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>165. people can “Start the spark of reciprocity by making requests as well as helping others. Help generously and without thought of return; but also ask often for what you need.”

                Had Peter been able to identify Brad from the start as a taker, he might never have gone down the road. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Giving and taking are based on our motives and values and they are choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Your fundamental concern is whether people are givers or takers but you've got this other axis, which is are they nice about it-is their fundamental demeanor welcoming? Homer had a hard edge. When he was locked onto a path, something that got in the way of that objective would just get swept away. But he had a big heart, and he wanted to be helpful .He was definitely off the charts on both giving and disagreeableness. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The other counterintuitive combination of appearances and motives is the agreeable taker, otherwise known as a faker. Like Ken Lay at Enron, these people come across as pleasant and charming but they are often aiming to get much more than they give. The ability to recognize agreeable takers as fakers is what protects givers against being exploited. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors but it's also a major source of vulnerability. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>It's built into my nature now not to give takers much time and certainly not waste my time with them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Otherish givers start our with trust as the default assumption, but they are willing to adjust their reciprocity style in exchange with someone who appears to be a taker by action or reputation. Being oterhish means that givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror,taking care to trust but verify. When dealing with takers, shifting into matcher mode is self-protective strategy. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>If they push too hard, they'll feel like takers, rather than givers. But when givers are advocating for someone else, pushing is closely aligned with their values of protecting and promoting the interest of others: givers can chalk it up to caring .And by offering relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they present themselves as agents advocating for others which is a powerful way to maintain their self-images and social images as givers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The most effective negotiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts' interests. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, others givers are able to think in more complex ways and identify win-win solutions that both takers and selfless givers miss. Instead of just giving away value like selfless givers, otherish givers create values first. By the time they give slices of pie away, the entire pie is big enough that there's plenty left to claim for themselves: they can give more and take more.

                1. As Samuel Johnson purportedly wrote, “The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2. Research shows that as people gain power, they feel large and in charge: less constrained and freer to express their natural tendencies. As takers gain power, they pay less attention to how they’re perceived by those below and next to them; they feel entitled to pursue self-serving goals and claim as much value as they can. Over time, treating peers and subordinates poorly jeopardizes their relationships and reputations<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3. After all, most people are matchers: their core values emphasize fairness, equality, and reciprocity. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>4. In networks, new research shows that when people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational information. “Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment,” write the social scientists Matthew Feinberg, Joey Cheng, and Robb Willer. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>5. As Wayne Baker, a University of Michigan sociologist and networking expert, explains, “If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from investments in meaningful activities and relationships.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>6. Since takers tend to be self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and myself—versus first-person plural pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>7. Another signal was compensation: the taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives in their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>8. For the taker CEOs, it was all about me. A big photo is self-glorifying, sending a clear message: “I am the central figure in this company.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>9. Tiny cues like words and photos can reveal profound clues about us, and research suggests that ordinary people can identify takers just by looking at their Facebook profiles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>10. The takers posted information that was rated as more self-promoting, self-absorbed, and self-important. They featured quotes that were evaluated as boastful and arrogant. The takers also had significantly more Facebook friends, racking up superficial connections so they could advertise their accomplishments and stay in touch to get favors, and posted vainer, more flattering pictures of themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>11. Rifkin reflects. “You never know where somebody’s going to end up. It’s not just about building your reputation; it really is about being there for other people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>12. The fact that Rifkin gives a lot more than he receives is a key point: takers and matchers also give in the context of networks, but they tend to give strategically, with an expected personal return that exceeds or equals their contributions. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>13. At its core, the giver approach extends a broader reach, and in doing so enlarges the range of potential payoffs, even though those payoffs are not the motivating engine.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>14. One of Rifkin’s maxims is “I believe in the strength of weak ties.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>15. But surprisingly, people were significantly more likely to benefit from weak ties. Almost 28 percent heard about the job from a weak tie. Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>16. The key is reconnecting, and it’s a major reason why givers succeed in the long run<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>17. Rifkin’s experience sheds new light on the old saying that what goes around comes around. These karmic moments can often be traced to the fact that matchers are on a mission to make them happen. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>18. His secret was deceptively simple: he asked thoughtful questions and listened with remarkable patience.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>19. The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>20. As Levin and colleagues explain, “reconnecting a dormant relationship is not like starting a relationship from scratch. When people reconnect, they still have feelings of trust.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>21. According to networking experts, reconnecting is a totally different experience for givers, especially in a wired world. Givers have a track record of generously sharing their knowledge, teaching us their skills, and helping us find jobs without worrying about what’s in it for them, so we’re glad to help them when they get back in touch with us.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>22. The takers were black holes. They sucked the energy from those around them. The givers were suns: they injected light around the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements. When they disagreed with suggestions, givers showed respect for the people who spoke up, rather than belittling them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>23. “I have always been a very genuine and kind-hearted person,” Stephanie says, “but I had tried to hide it and be more competitive so that I could get ahead. The important lesson I learned from Adam is that you can be a genuinely kind-hearted person and still get ahead in the world.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>24. By creating a norm of adding value, Rifkin transforms giving from a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>25.Giving, especially when it’s distinctive and consistent, establishes a pattern that shifts other people’s reciprocity styles within a group. It turns out that giving can be contagious. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>26. Since you can’t communicate with one another, giving is a risky strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>27. The more generous they were, the more respect and prestige they earned from their colleagues. Through giving more than they got, givers signaled their unique skills, demonstrated their value, and displayed their good intentions.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>28. Of all engineers, the most productive were those who gave often—and gave more than they received. These were the true givers, and they had the highest productivity and the highest status: they were revered by their peers. By giving often, engineers built up more trust and attracted more valuable help from across their work groups—not just from the people they helped.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>29. “I’ll sum up the key to success in one word: generosity,” writes Keith Ferrazzi. “If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>30. Geniuses tend to be takers: to promote their own interests, they “drain intelligence, energy, and capability” from others. Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their “intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities” of other people, Wiseman writes, such that “lightbulbs go off over people’s heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>31. The star investment analysts and the cardiac surgeons depended heavily on collaborators who knew them well or had strong skills of their own. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>32. Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak. Givers are more likely to see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness the skills of multiple people for a greater good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>33. Meyer summarizes his code of honor as “(1) Show up. (2) Work hard. (3) Be kind. (4) Take the high road.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>34. when people act generously in groups, they earn idiosyncrasy credits—positive impressions that accumulate in the minds of group members.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>35. Givers like Meyer do this naturally: they take care to recognize what other people contribute. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>36. “I tried to create a climate in the room where everybody feels that they can contribute, that it’s okay to fall on your face many, many times,” he says. This is known as psychological safety—the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>37. This is a perspective gap: when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>38. In collaborations, takers rarely cross this perspective gap. They’re so focused on their own viewpoints that they never end up seeing how others are reacting to their ideas and feedback. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>39. When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>40. The bloomers weren’t any smarter than their peers—the difference “was in the mind of the teacher.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>41. Teachers’ beliefs created self-fulfilling prophecies. When teachers believed their students were bloomers, they set high expectations for their success. As a result, the teachers engaged in more supportive behaviors that boosted the students’ confidence and enhanced their learning and development. Teachers communicated more warmly to the bloomers, gave them more challenging assignments.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>42. Overall, when managers were randomly assigned to see employees as bloomers, employees bloomed. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>43. Givers don’t wait for signs of potential. Because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people’s intentions, in their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone. By default, givers start by viewing people as bloomers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>44. Your husband, family, and friends love you because of the beautiful person you have made yourself—not because of a performance on an examination. Success doesn’t measure a human being, effort does.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>45. Today, we have compelling evidence that interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>46. By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>47. The psychologist Angela Duckworth calls this grit: having passion and perseverance toward long-term goals. Her research shows that above and beyond intelligence and aptitude, gritty people—by virtue of their interest, focus, and drive—achieve higher performance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>48. One of the keys to cultivating grit is making the task at hand more interesting and motivating.In Bloom’s study, across the board, the talented musicians and athletes were initially taught by givers, teachers who liked children and rewarded them with praise, signs of approval, or even candy when they did anything right. They were extremely encouraging. They were enthusiastic about the talent field and what they had to teach these children. In many cases... they treated the child as a friend of the family might. Perhaps the major quality of these teachers was that they made the initial learning very pleasant and rewarding.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>49. It turns out that givers are the least vulnerable to the mistake of overinvesting in people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>50. The givers, on the other hand, were primarily concerned about protecting other people and the organization, so they were more willing to admit their initial mistakes and de-escalate their commitment.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>51. Other studies show that people actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they’re choosing on behalf of others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>52. When Inman saw a guy practice with grit and play like a giver, he classified him as a diamond in the rough. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>53. In my own research, I’ve found that because of their dedication to others, givers are willing to work harder and longer than takers and matchers. Even when practice is no longer enjoyable, givers continue exerting effort out of a sense of responsibility to their team.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>54. Takers are attracted to, and excel in, gaining dominance. In an effort to claim as much value as possible, they strive to be superior to others. To establish dominance, takers specialize in powerful communication: they speak forcefully, raise their voices to assert their authority, express certainty to project confidence, promote their accomplishments, and sell with conviction and pride. They display strength by spreading their arms in dominant poses, raising their eyebrows in challenge, commanding as much physical space as possible, and conveying anger and issuing threats when necessary. In the quest for influence, takers set the tone and control the conversation by sending powerful verbal and nonverbal signals. As a result, takers tend to be much more effective than givers in gaining dominance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>55. The opposite of a taker’s powerful communication style is called powerless communication. Powerless communicators tend to speak less assertively, expressing plenty of doubt and relying heavily on advice from others. They talk in ways that signal vulnerability, revealing their weaknesses and making use of disclaimers, hedges, and hesitations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>56. In my role as a professor, I’ve always felt a strong sense of responsibility to give to my students, and I tend to be more concerned about connecting with students than establishing my authority. When I teach undergraduates, I open my very first class with a story about my biggest failures.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>57.  Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they’re interested in helping others, not gaining power over them, so they’re not afraid of exposing chinks in their armor. By making themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>58. expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker’s competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>59. Psychologists call this the pratfall effect. Spilling a cup of coffee hurt the image of the average candidate: it was just another reason for the audience to dislike him. But the same blunder helped the expert appear human and approachable—instead of superior and distant.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>60. It’s the givers, by virtue of their interest in getting to know us, who ask us the questions that enable us to experience the joy of learning from ourselves. And by giving us the floor, givers are actually learning about us and from us, which helps them figure out how to sell us things we already value.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>61. My job is to take the patient, ask the patient questions, and see what the patient needs. My mind-set is not to sell. My job is to help. My main purpose is to educate and inform patients on what’s important. My true concern in the long run is that the patient can see.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>62. He identified expert negotiators as those who were rated as highly effective by both sides, and had a strong track record of success with few failures. The expert negotiators spent much more time trying to understand the other side’s perspective.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>63. Takers tend to use powerful speech: they’re assertive and direct. Givers tend to use more powerless speech, talking with tentative markers like these.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>64.  Takers, the study’s authors report, “attain influence because they behave in ways that make them appear competent—even when they actually lack competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>65. Speaking dominantly convinces group members that takers are powerful, but it stifles information sharing, preventing members from communicating good ideas. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>66. New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>67. flattery only worked when it was coupled with advice seeking.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>68.  research shows that people who regularly seek advice and help from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by supervisors than those who never seek advice and help.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>69. Appearing vulnerable doesn’t bother givers, who worry far less about protecting their egos and projecting certainty. When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning from others. Matchers hold back on advice seeking for a different reason: they might owe something in return.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>70. He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>71. Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice. Giving advice makes takers feel important, and it makes givers feel helpful.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>72. When presenting, givers make it clear that they’re expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>73. The intelligent altruists, though less altruistic than the unintelligent altruists, will be fitter than both unintelligent altruists and selfish individuals.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>74. Success involves more than just capitalizing on the strengths of giving; it also requires avoiding the pitfalls. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>75.  The successful givers weren’t just more other-oriented than their peers; they were also more self-interested. Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>76.  Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>77. I’ve consistently found that self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>78. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>79. Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>80. across occupational sectors, teaching has the highest rates of emotional exhaustion.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>81. Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>82. Having a greater impact is one of the reasons why, counterintuitive as it might seem, giving more can actually help givers avoid burnout. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>83. Rather, “the change of context brought renewed energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>84. In one study, people who maintained equilibrium between benefiting themselves and others even achieved significant increases in happiness and life satisfaction over a six-month period.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>85. Chunking giving is an otherish strategy. In contrast, selfless givers are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping whenever people need them. This can become highly distracting and exhausting, robbing selfless givers of the attention and energy necessary to complete their own work.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>86. This is the 100-hour rule of volunteering. It appears to be the range where giving is maximally energizing and minimally draining.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>87. Research shows that if people start volunteering two hours a week, their happiness, satisfaction, and self-esteem go up a year later. Two hours a week in a fresh domain appears to be the sweet spot where people make a meaningful difference without being overwhelmed or sacrificing other priorities. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>88.  Giving has an energizing effect only if it’s an enjoyable, meaningful choice rather than undertaken out of duty and obligation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>89. But the reasons for giving mattered immensely: on days that people helped others out of a sense of enjoyment and purpose, they experienced significant gains in energy.* Giving for these reasons conferred a greater sense of autonomy, mastery, and connection to others, and it boosted their energy. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>90. Selfless givers are determined to be in the helper role, so they’re reluctant to burden or inconvenience others.In contrast, otherish givers recognize the importance of protecting their own well-being. When they’re on the brink of burnout, otherish givers seek help, which enables them to marshal the advice, assistance, and resources necessary to maintain their motivation and energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>91. Otherish givers build up a support network that they can access for help when they need it. This, along with chunking giving so that it’s energizing, is what makes otherish givers less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>92. although matchers and takers appear to be less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers, the greatest resilience may belong to otherish givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>93.  givers accrue an advantage in controlling their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Over time, giving may build willpower like weight lifting builds muscles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>94. Giving actually seemed to make people richer.Surprising as it seems, people who give more go on to earn more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>95. If you spend the money on yourself, your happiness doesn’t change. But if you spend the money on others, you actually report becoming significantly happier. This is otherish giving: you get to choose who you help, and it benefits you by improving your mood.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>96. giving actually activates the reward and meaning centers in our brains, which send us pleasure and purpose signals when we act for the benefit of others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>97. meaningfulness was associated with being a giver more than a taker.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>98. Overall, on average, happier people earn more money, get higher performance ratings, make better decisions, negotiate sweeter deals, and contribute more to their organizations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>99. otherish employees made more sustainable contributions than the selfless givers, takers, or matchers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>100. Ironically, because concern for their own interests sustains their energy, otherish givers actually give more than selfless givers.Otherish givers may appear less altruistic than selfless givers, but their resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>101. Becoming a doormat is the giver’s worst nightmare, and I’ll make the case that an otherish approach enables givers to escape the trap of being too trusting by becoming highly flexible and adaptable in their reciprocity styles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>102. I’ll also argue that an otherish style helps givers sidestep the land mines of being too empathetic and too timid by repurposing some skills that come naturally to them。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>103. Trust is one reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is trustworthy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>104. To avoid getting scammed or exploited, it’s critical to distinguish the genuine givers from the takers and fakers. Successful givers need to know who’s likely to manipulate them so that they can protect themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>105.  Giving and taking are based on our motives and values, and they’re choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. “Whether you’re nice or not nice is separate from whether you’re self-focused or other-focused. They’re independent, not opposites.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. We often overlook that there are disagreeable givers: people who are rough and tough in demeanor, but ultimately generous with their time, expertise, and connections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>107. The ability to recognize agreeable takers as fakers is what protects givers against being exploited. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>108. Although they don’t always put their skills to good use, givers have an instinctive advantage in sincerity screening. Research suggests that in general, givers are more accurate judges of others than matchers and takers. Givers are more attentive to others’ behaviors and more attuned to their thoughts and feelings, which makes it possible to pick up more clues—such as describing successes with first-person singular pronouns, like I and me instead of us and we. Givers also gain a sincerity screening advantage from habitually trusting others, which creates opportunities to see the wide range of behaviors of which other people are capable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>109. Over time, givers become sensitive to individual differences and shades of gray between the black-and-white boxes of agreeable and disagreeable.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>110. Once givers start to use their skills in sincerity screening to identify potential takers, they know when to put up their guard.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>111. Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it’s also a major source of vulnerability.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>112. As with the dating couples in love, empathy had turned Peter into a doormat—until he discovered an alternative to empathy that’s equally aligned with his natural strengths as a giver. Instead of contemplating Rich’s feelings, Peter considered what Rich was thinking. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>113. Studies led by Columbia psychologist Adam Galinsky show that when we empathize at the bargaining table, focusing on our counterparts’ emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much. But when we engage in perspective taking, considering our counterparts’ thoughts and interests, we’re more likely to find ways to make deals that satisfy our counterparts without sacrificing our own interests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>114. Once successful givers see the value of sincerity screening and begin to spot agreeable takers as potential fakers, they protect themselves by adjusting their behavior accordingly.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>115.  It’s wise to start out as a giver, since research shows that trust is hard to build but easy to destroy. But once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their reciprocity styles and shift to a matching strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>116. The takers acted competitively regardless of who their partners were. The rest adapted to their partners; they were cooperative when working with cooperative partners, but once a partner was competitive, they matched their behavior, responding in a more competitive manner. Game theorists call this tit for tat, and it’s a pure matcher strategy: start out cooperating, and stay cooperative unless your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, match the behavior by competing too. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>117. In generous tit for tat, the rule is “never forget a good turn, but occasionally forgive a bad one.”You start out cooperating and continue cooperating until your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, instead of always responding competitively, generous tit for tat usually means competing two thirds of the time, acting cooperatively in response to one of every three defections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>118. Being otherish means that givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror, taking care to trust but verify. When dealing with takers, shifting into matcher mode is a self-protective strategy. But one out of every three times, it may be wise to shift back into giver mode, granting so-called takers the opportunity to redeem themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>119. The men and women were equally qualified, but the men were earning substantially more money. Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, stared at the data in dismay. Although it was the twenty-first century, the male MBA graduates from her school had 7.6 percent higher salaries than their female counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>120. More than half of the men—57 percent—tried to negotiate their starting salaries, compared with only 7 percent of the women. The men were more than eight times as likely to negotiate as the women.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>121. Research shows that one of the main reasons that women tend to negotiate less assertively than men is that they worry about violating social expectations that they’ll be warm and kind.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>122. male executives landed the same salaries regardless of whether they were negotiating for themselves or others, whereas female executives did much better when negotiating for others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>123. Advocating for others was the key to Sameer’s chump change.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>124. By asking on behalf of his family, instead of himself, Sameer was maintaining an image as a giver. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>125. by offering relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they present themselves as agents advocating for others, which is a powerful way to maintain their self-images and social images as givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>126. The most effective negotiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts’ interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>127. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, otherish givers are able to think in more complex ways and identify win-win solutions that both takers and selfless givers miss. Instead of just giving away value like selfless givers, otherish givers create value first. By the time they give slices of pie away, the entire pie is big enough that there’s plenty left to claim for themselves: they can give more and take more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>128. Geller engaged others in sharing the workload, creating opportunities for them to become givers, while keeping himself from becoming overloaded.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>129. “If you have a natural mix of givers, takers, and matchers in your company,” Bauer says, “you can do a lot to magnify the giver tendency, suppress the more aggressive taker tendencies, and shift the matchers toward giving. There’s an energy and a satisfaction that you get out of it. In its own way, it’s addictive.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>130. Although many successful givers start from the default of trusting others’ intentions, they’re also careful to scan their environments to screen for potential takers, always ready to shift from feeling a taker’s emotions to analyzing a taker’s thoughts, and flex from giving unconditionally to a more measured approach of generous tit for tat. And when they feel inclined to back down, successful givers are prepared to draw reserves of assertiveness from their commitments to the people who matter to them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>131. If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they’re more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>132. He argued that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we experience a sense of oneness with the victim. We merge the victim into our sense of self. We see more of ourselves in the victim.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>133. Empathy leads to a sense of oneness, or self-other overlap, and this leads to greater helping.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>134.  Oneness is otherish. Most of the time that we give, it’s based on a cocktail of mixed motives to benefit others and ourselves. Takers and matchers may be most likely to give when they feel they can advance others’ interests and their own at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>135. For many volunteers, writing Wikipedia entries is otherish: it provides personal enjoyment and benefits others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>136.  It’s noteworthy that Freecycle’s formal mission statement highlights two sets of benefits: members can contribute to others and gain for themselves. The mission is to “build a worldwide gifting movement that reduces waste, saves precious resources &amp; eases the burden on our landfills while enabling our members to benefit from the strength of a larger community.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>137. Brewer calls it the principle of optimal distinctiveness: we look for ways to fit in and stand out.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>138. A popular way to achieve optimal distinctiveness is to join a unique group. Being part of a group with shared interests, identities, goals, values, skills, characteristics, or experiences gives us a sense of connection and belonging. At the same time, being part of a group that is clearly distinct from other groups gives us a sense of uniqueness. Studies show that people identify more strongly with individuals and groups that share unique similarities. The more rare a group, value, interest, skill, or experience is, the more likely it is to facilitate a bond.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>139. Knowing that other people were conserving energy was the best way to get residents to follow suit.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>140. Legitimizing small contributions draws in takers, making it difficult and embarrassing for them to say no, without dramatically reducing the amount donated by givers。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>141. When people join a group, they look for cues about appropriate behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>142. As Charles Darwin once wrote, a tribe with many people acting like givers, who “were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>143. Workplaces and schools are often designed to be zero-sum environments, with forced rankings and required grading curves that pit group members against one another in win-lose contests. In these settings, it’s only natural to assume that peers will lean in the taker direction, so people hold back on giving.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>144. In my experience, this is what happens in many businesses and universities: plenty of people hold giver values, but suppress or disguise them under the mistaken assumption that their peers don’t share these values. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>145. Of all the giving exchanges that occurred, roughly 90 percent were initiated by the recipient asking for help. Yet when we have a need, we’re often reluctant to ask for help. Much of the time, we’re embarrassed: we don’t want to look incompetent or needy, and we don’t want to burden others. As one Wharton dean explains, “The students call it Game Face: they feel pressured to look successful all the time. There can’t be any chinks in their armor, and opening up would make them vulnerable.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>146. In the Reciprocity Ring, because everyone is making a request, there’s little reason to be embarrassed. By making requests explicit and specific, participants provide potential givers with clear direction about how to contribute effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>147. Takers know that in a public setting, they’ll gain reputational benefits for being generous in sharing their knowledge, resources, and connections. If they don’t contribute, they look stingy and selfish, and they won’t get much help with their own requests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>148. Research shows that givers usually contribute regardless of whether it’s public or private, but takers are more likely to contribute when it’s public. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>149. By making contributions visible, the Reciprocity Ring sets up an opportunity for people of any reciprocity style to be otherish: they can do good and look good at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>150. This raises a fundamental question: does a generalized giving system like Freecycle or the Reciprocity Ring motivate takers to become better fakers, or can it actually turn takers into givers? In some ways, I’d say the motives don’t matter: it’s the behavior itself that counts. If takers are acting in ways that benefit others, even if the motives are primarily selfish rather than selfless or otherish, they’re making contributions that sustain generalized giving as a form of exchange.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>151. In a series of experiments led by NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, people who went public with their intentions to engage in an identity-relevant behavior were significantly less likely to engage in the behavior than people who kept their intentions private. When people made their identity plans known to others, they were able to claim the identity without actually following through on the behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>152. But even then, evidence suggests that privately signing a kindness pledge might backfire. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>153. Influence is far more powerful in the opposite direction: change people’s behaviors first, and their attitudes often follow.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>154. Research documents a similar process inside companies: as people make voluntary decisions to help colleagues and customers beyond the scope of their jobs, they come to see themselves as organizational citizens.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>155. Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return... after helping others... They just go on to something else... We should be like that.—Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>156. The brightest negotiators got better deals for their counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>157. “The smarter negotiator appears to be able to understand his or her opponents’ true interests and thus to provide them with better deals at little cost to him- or herself,” Barry and Friedman write. The more intelligent you are, the more you help your counterpart succeed.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>158. In the mind of a giver, the definition of success itself takes on a distinctive meaning. Whereas takers view success as attaining results that are superior to others’ and matchers see success in terms of balancing individual accomplishments with fairness to others, givers are inclined to follow Peter’s lead, characterizing success as individual achievements that have a positive impact on others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>159. This is what I find most magnetic about successful givers: they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>160. He asked them what they would enjoy doing that might also be of interest to other people. He inquired about their hobbies and personal interests, and what they would love to spend more time doing at the company. He then sent them out into the company to pursue their mission with three rules: it has to (1) appeal to at least one other person, (2) be low or no cost, and (3) be initiated by you.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>161. Job crafting involves innovating around a job description, creatively adding and customizing tasks and responsibilities to match personal interests and values.it involves creating a “before sketch” of how you currently allocate your time and energy, and then developing a visual “after diagram” of how you’d like to modify your job.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>162. A fascinating approach called the Love Machine was developed at Linden Lab, the company behind the virtual world Second Life. In a high-technology company, many employees aim to protect their time for themselves and guard information closely, instead of sharing their time and knowledge with colleagues. The Love Machine was designed to overcome this tendency by enabling employees to send a Love message when they appreciated help from a colleague. The Love messages were visible to others, rewarding and recognizing giving by linking it to status and reputations. One insider viewed it as a way to get “tech geeks to compete to see who could be the most helpful.” Love helped to “boost awareness of people who did tasks that were sometimes overlooked. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>163. “The more you give, the more you want to do it—as do others around you. It’s like going to the gym,” Nipun says. “If you’ve been working out your kindness muscles, you get stronger at it.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>164. Actions for impact<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        1. Test Your Giver Quotient. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        2. Run a Reciprocity Ring.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        3. Help Other People Craft Their Jobs—or Craft Yours to Incorporate More Giving.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        4. Start a Love Machine. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        5. Embrace the Five-Minute Favor.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        6. Practice Powerless Communication, but Become an Advocate.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        7. Join a Community of Givers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        8. Launch a Personal Generosity Experiment.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        9. Help Fund a Project. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        10. Seek Help More Often.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>165. people can “Start the spark of reciprocity by making requests as well as helping others. Help generously and without thought of return; but also ask often for what you need.”

                1. As Samuel Johnson purportedly wrote, “The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2. Research shows that as people gain power, they feel large and in charge: less constrained and freer to express their natural tendencies. As takers gain power, they pay less attention to how they’re perceived by those below and next to them; they feel entitled to pursue self-serving goals and claim as much value as they can. Over time, treating peers and subordinates poorly jeopardizes their relationships and reputations<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3. After all, most people are matchers: their core values emphasize fairness, equality, and reciprocity. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>4. In networks, new research shows that when people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational information. “Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment,” write the social scientists Matthew Feinberg, Joey Cheng, and Robb Willer. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>5. As Wayne Baker, a University of Michigan sociologist and networking expert, explains, “If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from investments in meaningful activities and relationships.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>6. Since takers tend to be self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and myself—versus first-person plural pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>7. Another signal was compensation: the taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives in their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>8. For the taker CEOs, it was all about me. A big photo is self-glorifying, sending a clear message: “I am the central figure in this company.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>9. Tiny cues like words and photos can reveal profound clues about us, and research suggests that ordinary people can identify takers just by looking at their Facebook profiles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>10. The takers posted information that was rated as more self-promoting, self-absorbed, and self-important. They featured quotes that were evaluated as boastful and arrogant. The takers also had significantly more Facebook friends, racking up superficial connections so they could advertise their accomplishments and stay in touch to get favors, and posted vainer, more flattering pictures of themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>11. Rifkin reflects. “You never know where somebody’s going to end up. It’s not just about building your reputation; it really is about being there for other people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>12. The fact that Rifkin gives a lot more than he receives is a key point: takers and matchers also give in the context of networks, but they tend to give strategically, with an expected personal return that exceeds or equals their contributions. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>13. At its core, the giver approach extends a broader reach, and in doing so enlarges the range of potential payoffs, even though those payoffs are not the motivating engine.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>14. One of Rifkin’s maxims is “I believe in the strength of weak ties.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>15. But surprisingly, people were significantly more likely to benefit from weak ties. Almost 28 percent heard about the job from a weak tie. Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>16. The key is reconnecting, and it’s a major reason why givers succeed in the long run<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>17. Rifkin’s experience sheds new light on the old saying that what goes around comes around. These karmic moments can often be traced to the fact that matchers are on a mission to make them happen. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>18. His secret was deceptively simple: he asked thoughtful questions and listened with remarkable patience.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>19. The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>20. As Levin and colleagues explain, “reconnecting a dormant relationship is not like starting a relationship from scratch. When people reconnect, they still have feelings of trust.” <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>21. According to networking experts, reconnecting is a totally different experience for givers, especially in a wired world. Givers have a track record of generously sharing their knowledge, teaching us their skills, and helping us find jobs without worrying about what’s in it for them, so we’re glad to help them when they get back in touch with us.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>22. The takers were black holes. They sucked the energy from those around them. The givers were suns: they injected light around the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements. When they disagreed with suggestions, givers showed respect for the people who spoke up, rather than belittling them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>23. “I have always been a very genuine and kind-hearted person,” Stephanie says, “but I had tried to hide it and be more competitive so that I could get ahead. The important lesson I learned from Adam is that you can be a genuinely kind-hearted person and still get ahead in the world.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>24. By creating a norm of adding value, Rifkin transforms giving from a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>25.Giving, especially when it’s distinctive and consistent, establishes a pattern that shifts other people’s reciprocity styles within a group. It turns out that giving can be contagious. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>26. Since you can’t communicate with one another, giving is a risky strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>27. The more generous they were, the more respect and prestige they earned from their colleagues. Through giving more than they got, givers signaled their unique skills, demonstrated their value, and displayed their good intentions.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>28. Of all engineers, the most productive were those who gave often—and gave more than they received. These were the true givers, and they had the highest productivity and the highest status: they were revered by their peers. By giving often, engineers built up more trust and attracted more valuable help from across their work groups—not just from the people they helped.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>29. “I’ll sum up the key to success in one word: generosity,” writes Keith Ferrazzi. “If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>30. Geniuses tend to be takers: to promote their own interests, they “drain intelligence, energy, and capability” from others. Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their “intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities” of other people, Wiseman writes, such that “lightbulbs go off over people’s heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>31. The star investment analysts and the cardiac surgeons depended heavily on collaborators who knew them well or had strong skills of their own. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>32. Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak. Givers are more likely to see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness the skills of multiple people for a greater good.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>33. Meyer summarizes his code of honor as “(1) Show up. (2) Work hard. (3) Be kind. (4) Take the high road.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>34. when people act generously in groups, they earn idiosyncrasy credits—positive impressions that accumulate in the minds of group members.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>35. Givers like Meyer do this naturally: they take care to recognize what other people contribute. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>36. “I tried to create a climate in the room where everybody feels that they can contribute, that it’s okay to fall on your face many, many times,” he says. This is known as psychological safety—the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>37. This is a perspective gap: when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>38. In collaborations, takers rarely cross this perspective gap. They’re so focused on their own viewpoints that they never end up seeing how others are reacting to their ideas and feedback. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>39. When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>40. The bloomers weren’t any smarter than their peers—the difference “was in the mind of the teacher.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>41. Teachers’ beliefs created self-fulfilling prophecies. When teachers believed their students were bloomers, they set high expectations for their success. As a result, the teachers engaged in more supportive behaviors that boosted the students’ confidence and enhanced their learning and development. Teachers communicated more warmly to the bloomers, gave them more challenging assignments.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>42. Overall, when managers were randomly assigned to see employees as bloomers, employees bloomed. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>43. Givers don’t wait for signs of potential. Because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people’s intentions, in their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone. By default, givers start by viewing people as bloomers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>44. Your husband, family, and friends love you because of the beautiful person you have made yourself—not because of a performance on an examination. Success doesn’t measure a human being, effort does.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>45. Today, we have compelling evidence that interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>46. By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>47. The psychologist Angela Duckworth calls this grit: having passion and perseverance toward long-term goals. Her research shows that above and beyond intelligence and aptitude, gritty people—by virtue of their interest, focus, and drive—achieve higher performance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>48. One of the keys to cultivating grit is making the task at hand more interesting and motivating.In Bloom’s study, across the board, the talented musicians and athletes were initially taught by givers, teachers who liked children and rewarded them with praise, signs of approval, or even candy when they did anything right. They were extremely encouraging. They were enthusiastic about the talent field and what they had to teach these children. In many cases... they treated the child as a friend of the family might. Perhaps the major quality of these teachers was that they made the initial learning very pleasant and rewarding.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>49. It turns out that givers are the least vulnerable to the mistake of overinvesting in people.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>50. The givers, on the other hand, were primarily concerned about protecting other people and the organization, so they were more willing to admit their initial mistakes and de-escalate their commitment.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>51. Other studies show that people actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they’re choosing on behalf of others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>52. When Inman saw a guy practice with grit and play like a giver, he classified him as a diamond in the rough. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>53. In my own research, I’ve found that because of their dedication to others, givers are willing to work harder and longer than takers and matchers. Even when practice is no longer enjoyable, givers continue exerting effort out of a sense of responsibility to their team.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>54. Takers are attracted to, and excel in, gaining dominance. In an effort to claim as much value as possible, they strive to be superior to others. To establish dominance, takers specialize in powerful communication: they speak forcefully, raise their voices to assert their authority, express certainty to project confidence, promote their accomplishments, and sell with conviction and pride. They display strength by spreading their arms in dominant poses, raising their eyebrows in challenge, commanding as much physical space as possible, and conveying anger and issuing threats when necessary. In the quest for influence, takers set the tone and control the conversation by sending powerful verbal and nonverbal signals. As a result, takers tend to be much more effective than givers in gaining dominance. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>55. The opposite of a taker’s powerful communication style is called powerless communication. Powerless communicators tend to speak less assertively, expressing plenty of doubt and relying heavily on advice from others. They talk in ways that signal vulnerability, revealing their weaknesses and making use of disclaimers, hedges, and hesitations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>56. In my role as a professor, I’ve always felt a strong sense of responsibility to give to my students, and I tend to be more concerned about connecting with students than establishing my authority. When I teach undergraduates, I open my very first class with a story about my biggest failures.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>57.  Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they’re interested in helping others, not gaining power over them, so they’re not afraid of exposing chinks in their armor. By making themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>58. expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker’s competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>59. Psychologists call this the pratfall effect. Spilling a cup of coffee hurt the image of the average candidate: it was just another reason for the audience to dislike him. But the same blunder helped the expert appear human and approachable—instead of superior and distant.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>60. It’s the givers, by virtue of their interest in getting to know us, who ask us the questions that enable us to experience the joy of learning from ourselves. And by giving us the floor, givers are actually learning about us and from us, which helps them figure out how to sell us things we already value.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>61. My job is to take the patient, ask the patient questions, and see what the patient needs. My mind-set is not to sell. My job is to help. My main purpose is to educate and inform patients on what’s important. My true concern in the long run is that the patient can see.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>62. He identified expert negotiators as those who were rated as highly effective by both sides, and had a strong track record of success with few failures. The expert negotiators spent much more time trying to understand the other side’s perspective.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>63. Takers tend to use powerful speech: they’re assertive and direct. Givers tend to use more powerless speech, talking with tentative markers like these.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>64.  Takers, the study’s authors report, “attain influence because they behave in ways that make them appear competent—even when they actually lack competence.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>65. Speaking dominantly convinces group members that takers are powerful, but it stifles information sharing, preventing members from communicating good ideas. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>66. New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>67. flattery only worked when it was coupled with advice seeking.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>68.  research shows that people who regularly seek advice and help from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by supervisors than those who never seek advice and help.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>69. Appearing vulnerable doesn’t bother givers, who worry far less about protecting their egos and projecting certainty. When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning from others. Matchers hold back on advice seeking for a different reason: they might owe something in return.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>70. He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>71. Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice. Giving advice makes takers feel important, and it makes givers feel helpful.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>72. When presenting, givers make it clear that they’re expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>73. The intelligent altruists, though less altruistic than the unintelligent altruists, will be fitter than both unintelligent altruists and selfish individuals.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>74. Success involves more than just capitalizing on the strengths of giving; it also requires avoiding the pitfalls. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>75.  The successful givers weren’t just more other-oriented than their peers; they were also more self-interested. Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>76.  Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>77. I’ve consistently found that self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>78. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>79. Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>80. across occupational sectors, teaching has the highest rates of emotional exhaustion.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>81. Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>82. Having a greater impact is one of the reasons why, counterintuitive as it might seem, giving more can actually help givers avoid burnout. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>83. Rather, “the change of context brought renewed energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>84. In one study, people who maintained equilibrium between benefiting themselves and others even achieved significant increases in happiness and life satisfaction over a six-month period.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>85. Chunking giving is an otherish strategy. In contrast, selfless givers are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping whenever people need them. This can become highly distracting and exhausting, robbing selfless givers of the attention and energy necessary to complete their own work.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>86. This is the 100-hour rule of volunteering. It appears to be the range where giving is maximally energizing and minimally draining.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>87. Research shows that if people start volunteering two hours a week, their happiness, satisfaction, and self-esteem go up a year later. Two hours a week in a fresh domain appears to be the sweet spot where people make a meaningful difference without being overwhelmed or sacrificing other priorities. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>88.  Giving has an energizing effect only if it’s an enjoyable, meaningful choice rather than undertaken out of duty and obligation. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>89. But the reasons for giving mattered immensely: on days that people helped others out of a sense of enjoyment and purpose, they experienced significant gains in energy.* Giving for these reasons conferred a greater sense of autonomy, mastery, and connection to others, and it boosted their energy. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>90. Selfless givers are determined to be in the helper role, so they’re reluctant to burden or inconvenience others.In contrast, otherish givers recognize the importance of protecting their own well-being. When they’re on the brink of burnout, otherish givers seek help, which enables them to marshal the advice, assistance, and resources necessary to maintain their motivation and energy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>91. Otherish givers build up a support network that they can access for help when they need it. This, along with chunking giving so that it’s energizing, is what makes otherish givers less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>92. although matchers and takers appear to be less vulnerable to burnout than selfless givers, the greatest resilience may belong to otherish givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>93.  givers accrue an advantage in controlling their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Over time, giving may build willpower like weight lifting builds muscles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>94. Giving actually seemed to make people richer.Surprising as it seems, people who give more go on to earn more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>95. If you spend the money on yourself, your happiness doesn’t change. But if you spend the money on others, you actually report becoming significantly happier. This is otherish giving: you get to choose who you help, and it benefits you by improving your mood.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>96. giving actually activates the reward and meaning centers in our brains, which send us pleasure and purpose signals when we act for the benefit of others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>97. meaningfulness was associated with being a giver more than a taker.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>98. Overall, on average, happier people earn more money, get higher performance ratings, make better decisions, negotiate sweeter deals, and contribute more to their organizations.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>99. otherish employees made more sustainable contributions than the selfless givers, takers, or matchers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>100. Ironically, because concern for their own interests sustains their energy, otherish givers actually give more than selfless givers.Otherish givers may appear less altruistic than selfless givers, but their resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>101. Becoming a doormat is the giver’s worst nightmare, and I’ll make the case that an otherish approach enables givers to escape the trap of being too trusting by becoming highly flexible and adaptable in their reciprocity styles. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>102. I’ll also argue that an otherish style helps givers sidestep the land mines of being too empathetic and too timid by repurposing some skills that come naturally to them。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>103. Trust is one reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is trustworthy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>104. To avoid getting scammed or exploited, it’s critical to distinguish the genuine givers from the takers and fakers. Successful givers need to know who’s likely to manipulate them so that they can protect themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>105.  Giving and taking are based on our motives and values, and they’re choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. “Whether you’re nice or not nice is separate from whether you’re self-focused or other-focused. They’re independent, not opposites.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>106. We often overlook that there are disagreeable givers: people who are rough and tough in demeanor, but ultimately generous with their time, expertise, and connections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>107. The ability to recognize agreeable takers as fakers is what protects givers against being exploited. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>108. Although they don’t always put their skills to good use, givers have an instinctive advantage in sincerity screening. Research suggests that in general, givers are more accurate judges of others than matchers and takers. Givers are more attentive to others’ behaviors and more attuned to their thoughts and feelings, which makes it possible to pick up more clues—such as describing successes with first-person singular pronouns, like I and me instead of us and we. Givers also gain a sincerity screening advantage from habitually trusting others, which creates opportunities to see the wide range of behaviors of which other people are capable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>109. Over time, givers become sensitive to individual differences and shades of gray between the black-and-white boxes of agreeable and disagreeable.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>110. Once givers start to use their skills in sincerity screening to identify potential takers, they know when to put up their guard.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>111. Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it’s also a major source of vulnerability.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>112. As with the dating couples in love, empathy had turned Peter into a doormat—until he discovered an alternative to empathy that’s equally aligned with his natural strengths as a giver. Instead of contemplating Rich’s feelings, Peter considered what Rich was thinking. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>113. Studies led by Columbia psychologist Adam Galinsky show that when we empathize at the bargaining table, focusing on our counterparts’ emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much. But when we engage in perspective taking, considering our counterparts’ thoughts and interests, we’re more likely to find ways to make deals that satisfy our counterparts without sacrificing our own interests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>114. Once successful givers see the value of sincerity screening and begin to spot agreeable takers as potential fakers, they protect themselves by adjusting their behavior accordingly.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>115.  It’s wise to start out as a giver, since research shows that trust is hard to build but easy to destroy. But once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their reciprocity styles and shift to a matching strategy.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>116. The takers acted competitively regardless of who their partners were. The rest adapted to their partners; they were cooperative when working with cooperative partners, but once a partner was competitive, they matched their behavior, responding in a more competitive manner. Game theorists call this tit for tat, and it’s a pure matcher strategy: start out cooperating, and stay cooperative unless your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, match the behavior by competing too. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>117. In generous tit for tat, the rule is “never forget a good turn, but occasionally forgive a bad one.”You start out cooperating and continue cooperating until your counterpart competes. When your counterpart competes, instead of always responding competitively, generous tit for tat usually means competing two thirds of the time, acting cooperatively in response to one of every three defections. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>118. Being otherish means that givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror, taking care to trust but verify. When dealing with takers, shifting into matcher mode is a self-protective strategy. But one out of every three times, it may be wise to shift back into giver mode, granting so-called takers the opportunity to redeem themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>119. The men and women were equally qualified, but the men were earning substantially more money. Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, stared at the data in dismay. Although it was the twenty-first century, the male MBA graduates from her school had 7.6 percent higher salaries than their female counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>120. More than half of the men—57 percent—tried to negotiate their starting salaries, compared with only 7 percent of the women. The men were more than eight times as likely to negotiate as the women.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>121. Research shows that one of the main reasons that women tend to negotiate less assertively than men is that they worry about violating social expectations that they’ll be warm and kind.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>122. male executives landed the same salaries regardless of whether they were negotiating for themselves or others, whereas female executives did much better when negotiating for others than themselves.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>123. Advocating for others was the key to Sameer’s chump change.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>124. By asking on behalf of his family, instead of himself, Sameer was maintaining an image as a giver. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>125. by offering relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they present themselves as agents advocating for others, which is a powerful way to maintain their self-images and social images as givers.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>126. The most effective negotiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts’ interests.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>127. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, otherish givers are able to think in more complex ways and identify win-win solutions that both takers and selfless givers miss. Instead of just giving away value like selfless givers, otherish givers create value first. By the time they give slices of pie away, the entire pie is big enough that there’s plenty left to claim for themselves: they can give more and take more.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>128. Geller engaged others in sharing the workload, creating opportunities for them to become givers, while keeping himself from becoming overloaded.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>129. “If you have a natural mix of givers, takers, and matchers in your company,” Bauer says, “you can do a lot to magnify the giver tendency, suppress the more aggressive taker tendencies, and shift the matchers toward giving. There’s an energy and a satisfaction that you get out of it. In its own way, it’s addictive.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>130. Although many successful givers start from the default of trusting others’ intentions, they’re also careful to scan their environments to screen for potential takers, always ready to shift from feeling a taker’s emotions to analyzing a taker’s thoughts, and flex from giving unconditionally to a more measured approach of generous tit for tat. And when they feel inclined to back down, successful givers are prepared to draw reserves of assertiveness from their commitments to the people who matter to them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>131. If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they’re more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>132. He argued that when we empathize with a victim in need, we become so emotionally attached that we experience a sense of oneness with the victim. We merge the victim into our sense of self. We see more of ourselves in the victim.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>133. Empathy leads to a sense of oneness, or self-other overlap, and this leads to greater helping.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>134.  Oneness is otherish. Most of the time that we give, it’s based on a cocktail of mixed motives to benefit others and ourselves. Takers and matchers may be most likely to give when they feel they can advance others’ interests and their own at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>135. For many volunteers, writing Wikipedia entries is otherish: it provides personal enjoyment and benefits others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>136.  It’s noteworthy that Freecycle’s formal mission statement highlights two sets of benefits: members can contribute to others and gain for themselves. The mission is to “build a worldwide gifting movement that reduces waste, saves precious resources &amp; eases the burden on our landfills while enabling our members to benefit from the strength of a larger community.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>137. Brewer calls it the principle of optimal distinctiveness: we look for ways to fit in and stand out.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>138. A popular way to achieve optimal distinctiveness is to join a unique group. Being part of a group with shared interests, identities, goals, values, skills, characteristics, or experiences gives us a sense of connection and belonging. At the same time, being part of a group that is clearly distinct from other groups gives us a sense of uniqueness. Studies show that people identify more strongly with individuals and groups that share unique similarities. The more rare a group, value, interest, skill, or experience is, the more likely it is to facilitate a bond.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>139. Knowing that other people were conserving energy was the best way to get residents to follow suit.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>140. Legitimizing small contributions draws in takers, making it difficult and embarrassing for them to say no, without dramatically reducing the amount donated by givers。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>141. When people join a group, they look for cues about appropriate behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>142. As Charles Darwin once wrote, a tribe with many people acting like givers, who “were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>143. Workplaces and schools are often designed to be zero-sum environments, with forced rankings and required grading curves that pit group members against one another in win-lose contests. In these settings, it’s only natural to assume that peers will lean in the taker direction, so people hold back on giving.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>144. In my experience, this is what happens in many businesses and universities: plenty of people hold giver values, but suppress or disguise them under the mistaken assumption that their peers don’t share these values. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>145. Of all the giving exchanges that occurred, roughly 90 percent were initiated by the recipient asking for help. Yet when we have a need, we’re often reluctant to ask for help. Much of the time, we’re embarrassed: we don’t want to look incompetent or needy, and we don’t want to burden others. As one Wharton dean explains, “The students call it Game Face: they feel pressured to look successful all the time. There can’t be any chinks in their armor, and opening up would make them vulnerable.”<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>146. In the Reciprocity Ring, because everyone is making a request, there’s little reason to be embarrassed. By making requests explicit and specific, participants provide potential givers with clear direction about how to contribute effectively.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>147. Takers know that in a public setting, they’ll gain reputational benefits for being generous in sharing their knowledge, resources, and connections. If they don’t contribute, they look stingy and selfish, and they won’t get much help with their own requests. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>148. Research shows that givers usually contribute regardless of whether it’s public or private, but takers are more likely to contribute when it’s public. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>149. By making contributions visible, the Reciprocity Ring sets up an opportunity for people of any reciprocity style to be otherish: they can do good and look good at the same time.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>150. This raises a fundamental question: does a generalized giving system like Freecycle or the Reciprocity Ring motivate takers to become better fakers, or can it actually turn takers into givers? In some ways, I’d say the motives don’t matter: it’s the behavior itself that counts. If takers are acting in ways that benefit others, even if the motives are primarily selfish rather than selfless or otherish, they’re making contributions that sustain generalized giving as a form of exchange.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>151. In a series of experiments led by NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, people who went public with their intentions to engage in an identity-relevant behavior were significantly less likely to engage in the behavior than people who kept their intentions private. When people made their identity plans known to others, they were able to claim the identity without actually following through on the behavior.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>152. But even then, evidence suggests that privately signing a kindness pledge might backfire. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>153. Influence is far more powerful in the opposite direction: change people’s behaviors first, and their attitudes often follow.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>154. Research documents a similar process inside companies: as people make voluntary decisions to help colleagues and customers beyond the scope of their jobs, they come to see themselves as organizational citizens.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>155. Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return... after helping others... They just go on to something else... We should be like that.—Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>156. The brightest negotiators got better deals for their counterparts.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>157. “The smarter negotiator appears to be able to understand his or her opponents’ true interests and thus to provide them with better deals at little cost to him- or herself,” Barry and Friedman write. The more intelligent you are, the more you help your counterpart succeed.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>158. In the mind of a giver, the definition of success itself takes on a distinctive meaning. Whereas takers view success as attaining results that are superior to others’ and matchers see success in terms of balancing individual accomplishments with fairness to others, givers are inclined to follow Peter’s lead, characterizing success as individual achievements that have a positive impact on others.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>159. This is what I find most magnetic about successful givers: they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>160. He asked them what they would enjoy doing that might also be of interest to other people. He inquired about their hobbies and personal interests, and what they would love to spend more time doing at the company. He then sent them out into the company to pursue their mission with three rules: it has to (1) appeal to at least one other person, (2) be low or no cost, and (3) be initiated by you.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>161. Job crafting involves innovating around a job description, creatively adding and customizing tasks and responsibilities to match personal interests and values.it involves creating a “before sketch” of how you currently allocate your time and energy, and then developing a visual “after diagram” of how you’d like to modify your job.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>162. A fascinating approach called the Love Machine was developed at Linden Lab, the company behind the virtual world Second Life. In a high-technology company, many employees aim to protect their time for themselves and guard information closely, instead of sharing their time and knowledge with colleagues. The Love Machine was designed to overcome this tendency by enabling employees to send a Love message when they appreciated help from a colleague. The Love messages were visible to others, rewarding and recognizing giving by linking it to status and reputations. One insider viewed it as a way to get “tech geeks to compete to see who could be the most helpful.” Love helped to “boost awareness of people who did tasks that were sometimes overlooked. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>163. “The more you give, the more you want to do it—as do others around you. It’s like going to the gym,” Nipun says. “If you’ve been working out your kindness muscles, you get stronger at it.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>164.

Help generously and without thought of return; but also ask often for what you need.”

                Had Peter been able to identify Brad from the start as a taker, he might never have gone down the road. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Giving and taking are based on our motives and values and they are choices that we make regardless of whether our personalities trend agreeable or disagreeable. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Your fundamental concern is whether people are givers or takers but you've got this other axis, which is are they nice about it-is their fundamental demeanor welcoming? Homer had a hard edge. When he was locked onto a path, something that got in the way of that objective would just get swept away. But he had a big heart, and he wanted to be helpful .He was definitely off the charts on both giving and disagreeableness. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The other counterintuitive combination of appearances and motives is the agreeable taker, otherwise known as a faker. Like Ken Lay at Enron, these people come across as pleasant and charming but they are often aiming to get much more than they give. The ability to recognize agreeable takers as fakers is what protects givers against being exploited. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors but it's also a major source of vulnerability. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>It's built into my nature now not to give takers much time and certainly not waste my time with them.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Otherish givers start our with trust as the default assumption, but they are willing to adjust their reciprocity style in exchange with someone who appears to be a taker by action or reputation. Being oterhish means that givers keep their own interests in the rearview mirror,taking care to trust but verify. When dealing with takers, shifting into matcher mode is self-protective strategy. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>If they push too hard, they'll feel like takers, rather than givers. But when givers are advocating for someone else, pushing is closely aligned with their values of protecting and promoting the interest of others: givers can chalk it up to caring .And by offering relational accounts, givers do more than just think of themselves as agents advocating for others; they present themselves as agents advocating for others which is a powerful way to maintain their self-images and social images as givers. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The most effective negotiators were otherish: they reported high concern for their own interests and high concern for their counterparts' interests. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, others givers are able to think in more complex ways and identify win-win solutions that both takers and selfless givers miss. Instead of just giving away value like selfless givers, otherish givers create values first. By the time they give slices of pie away, the entire pie is big enough that there's plenty left to claim for themselves: they can give more and take more.
