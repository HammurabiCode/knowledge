    <p>After enduring an injury at Dunkirk during World War II, Laurie Odell is sent to a rural veterans&#39; hospital in England to convalesce. There he befriends the young, bright Andrew, a conscientious objector serving as an orderly. As they find solace and companionship together in the idyllic surroundings of the hospital, their friendship blooms into a discreet, chaste romance. Then one day, Ralph Lanyon, a mentor from Laurie&#39;s schoolboy days, suddenly reappears in Laurie&#39;s life, and draws him into a tight-knit social circle of world-weary gay men. Laurie is forced to choose between the sweet ideals of innocence and the distinct pleasures of experience.</p>    <p>Originally published in the United States in 1959, The Charioteer is a bold, unapologetic portrayal of male homosexuality during World War II that stands with Gore Vidal&#39;s The City and the Pillar and Christopher Isherwood&#39;s Berlin Stories as a monumental work in gay literature.</p>    <p>举报</p>    <p>作者简介  · · · · · ·</p>    <p>Mary Renault (1905-1983) was born in London and educated at St Hughs, Oxford. She trained as a nurse at Oxford&#39;s Radcliffe Infirmary, where she met her lifelong partner, Julie Mullard. Her first novel, Purposes of Love, was published in 1937. In 1948, after North Face won a MGM prize worth $150,000, she and Mullard emigrated to South Africa. There, Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time - in her masterpiece, The Charioteer (1953), and then in her first historical novel, The Last of the Wine (1956). Renault&#39;s vivid novels set in the ancient world brought her worldwide fame. In 2010 Fire From Heaven was shortlisted for the Lost Booker of 1970.</p></div>

                <blockquote><q>As he lay listening, Laurie's whole being seemed to relax in a sigh of mysterious contentment. Even the day's disaster withdrew into a distance where it was known rather than felt. All the tangles of his life seemed looser and easier to resolve. He didn't want to take his mind from the story, or disturb with analysis this fragile happiness and security, which were what one might feel if some legend, dear to one's childhood but long abandoned, were marvellously proved true.
&quot;... these big ocean-going dhows that come over from Arabia with the monsoon. They have a high carved poop like a caravel, and a raked-up bowsprit. There were a lot of them coming into the Old Harbor the way they do, covered in tassels and pennants with the crews singing and dancing on the decks, and beating drums and gongs. Just after we'd passed them ...&quot;
The strange feeling of fulfillment touched Laurie again; suddenly he remembered and understood. In the weeks of summer holiday seven years before, after he had read the Phaedrus by the stream in the wood, he had gone for long walks alone, and, returning, sat n the evening by a September fire, so silent and enclosed that more than once his mother had asked if he was well. It was of this that he had been dreaming.
Involuntarily he moved his hands so that they covered his face, as the dream came back in all the high colors of boyhood: his own room with the fire he had, as a rule, only on the first day of the holidays, furnished as he had thought, then, he would want it when he was older; the flickering light on leather and books; and Ralph's face at nineteen. In the dream there had always been a pause in which he had looked up and said, &quot;Next time you go away, I'm going with you&quot;; and Ralph, who hadn't had a first name in those days, had looked down all the same and answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;</q></blockquote>

                <blockquote><q>The party had warmed up by this time. A momentary detachment came upon Laurie as he looked on. After some years of muddled thinking on the subject [of his homosexual desire], he suddenly saw quite clearly what it was he had been running away from; why he had refused Sandy's first invitation, and what the trouble had been with Charles. It was also the trouble, he perceived, with nine-tenths of the people here tonight. They were specialists. They had not merely accepted their limitations [i.e. attraction to men], as Laurie was ready to accept his, loyal to his humanity if not to his sex, and bringing an extra humility to the hard study of human experience. They had identify themselves with their limitations; they were making a career of them. They had turned from all other reality, and curled up in them snugly, as in a womb.</q></blockquote><div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Renault在第6章用了近50页的篇幅写了一场同性恋者派对，主人公Laurie与旧友Ralph在这里重逢，此章结尾，Ralph送Laurie回家。这是Laurie第一次参加同性恋者的聚会，作者融合电影感和心理描写的手法尽显其写实功力。形形色色的人，不乏浮夸之辈，我们今天在Destination和Alfa仍能碰见。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>上段是Laurie的思绪，其中包含一个名句：「loyal to his humanity if not to his sex[性别], and bringing an extra humility to the hard study of human experience.」显然这也是Renault的看法。小说出版近60年后，同性恋者的社会地位有了极大提高，批评这段话过时是很容易的。的确，作者用了limitations（局限）和extra humility（多一分谦卑）这两个词，似乎暗示同性恋不如异性恋。但我们不应苛求作者，而应该看到她当时把这个题材写到这个程度，已经远远走在时代之前，以及需要付出多大的道德勇气。社会的进步其实有她的功劳。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>何况，Renault的看法有一个我认为并不过时的核心：性吸引不是同性恋者生活的全部，同性恋者如果自动去将这一部分无限放大，会受困囿（见于They had identify themselves with their limitations; they were making a career of them. They had turned from all other reality等语）。人应该充分实现自己的潜能；一个标签，并不能概括人的全面与丰富。你是同性恋者，并不代表你就要出入于某个特定的圈子，或按照某种模式生活。不要以性倾向将朋友分门别类。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>说到底，gay pride不是I'm pride because I'm gay，而是because I'm a good person AND gay. Good排在gay的前面。What's good容或有不同理解，但人至少应该有所追求。<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>《The Charioteer》的人物塑造曾经受到一些同志文学史研究者的批评，也有人为之辩护。我感觉此书的人物总体上还是很真实的，她只不过写出1940年代的现实环境，没有刻意拔高而已。书中有太完美的人物反而不值一读。张爱玲说：既然是个写小说的，就应该尽量表现出故事中人物的力，不要凭空给他们创造出力来。这话Renault应该会同意。Laurie的故事的力，来自他的道德感与现实之间的紧张关系。

                <blockquote><q>The sun slanted deep into the wood, making hidden birds sing softly. The touch of autumn struck from his youth that cosmic sadness, which time will tame like the bite of spring. Under the pale sun, beauty and fate and love and death ached through him. After a while he sighed, and took out his book.
He found that the sea water hadn't soaked in beyond the notes at the back. The front cover unfortunately recalled the butcher's order book which his mother used to keep, fastidiously, apart from the others; but though the tops of the pages were stained, they parted easily, and inside they were clean. He turned them to and fro, remembering other places where he had read them: in a punt moored to a wilow by Magdalen Bridge, on a packing-case behind a Nissen hut; and the first time of all, in a sunny clearing with a stream running through it, a short way from his home. It had struck him with religious awe to find Phaedrus leading Socrates almost, it might have bee, to the very spot. The spreading tree, the green bank to lean on, the water cold to the foot: nothing had been wanting, except the votive offerings and the shrine. &quot;Give me to be beautiful within,&quot; Socrates had prayed, &quot;and for me let outward and inward things be reconciled together.&quot;
Laurie turned the pages gently; they separately at the top with a crisp little sound. He found the part he was looking for and smoothed it open.
... and so it is with the followers of the other gods. Each man in his life honors, and imitates as well as he can, that god to whose choir he belonged, while he is uncorrupted in his first incarnation here; and in the fashion he has thus learned, he bears himself to his beloved as well as to the rest. So, then, each chooses from among the beautiful a love conforming to his kind; and then, as if his chosen were his god, he sets him up and robes him for worship. ...
Laurie looked up at the barley; if any of the beautiful and ruthless Olympians had owned him they had lost him, he thought.
... and this striving to discover the essence of their proper god, by tracing him in themselves, is rewarded; for they are force to look on the god without flinching, and when their memory holds him, his breath inspires them, and they share his attributes and his life, as far as man can enter godhead. And for these blessings they thank the loved one, loving him even more dearly. ...
Laurie put down the book and folded his arms behind his head. He was not analytical enough yet to have discovered that there are certain loves, and certain phases of love, which bring perfect happiness only in their pauses and internals, as water grows clear when one's progress has ceased to stir it.
... and it fills the soul of the beloved also ...
As he read on, a cock pheasant made easy by his stillness came picking within a few yards of his feet.
He is in love, therefore, but with whom he cannot say; he does not know what has become of him, he cannot tell. He sees himself in ...
The pheasant, startled, burst up almost into Laurie's face and whirred away; but he scarcely noticed it.
... he sees himself in his lover as if in a mirror, not knowing whom he sees. And when they are together, he too is released from pain, and when apart, he longs as he himself is longed for; for reflected in his heart is love's image, which is love's answer. But he calls it, and believes it, not love but friendship; though he too ----
&quot;That book must be good,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;What is it?&quot;
Laurie felt his heart jerk like a shot deer. An uncontrollable reflex, as he sat up, made him slap the book shut and lean his hand on it.
&quot;Good Lord, Andrew,&quot; he said breathlessly, &quot;you made me jump half out of my skin.&quot;
Andrew came out of the wood behind him, from the footpath he had forgotten.
&quot;Well, I needed that to make me believe you weren't cutting me on purpose. You looked too absorbed to be true.&quot;
Something in his voice made Laurie look up at him. His air of ease had not come easily; he was acting; it surprised Laurie to see that he could do it so well. More, he looked tired; for the first time since he had gone on night duty there were dark smears under his eyes.
&quot;Sit down, you're giving me a crick in the neck.&quot; Straining not to betray himself or to sound unwelcoming, Laurie could feel himself striking a note of appalling heartiness, like a housemaster on sports day. &quot;What a desperate character you are, turning day into night like this. It's only ten to three. What happened?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Andrew sat down on the grass beside him. &quot;I felt like a walk.&quot;
&quot;If I'd known I'd have waited for you. How did you know where to look?&quot;
&quot;I asked Reg Barker, of course. I always do.&quot;
&quot;Do you?&quot; He did not add that Reg had never mentioned it. &quot;Have some blackberries.&quot; He had picked a leafful on the way.
Andrew ate one and, turning the next one over, said, &quot;I thought you might - I mean, if you'd rather be on your own do tell me. Honestly, I shall quite ----&quot;
The lovers of the innocent must protect them above all from the knowledge of their own cruelty. &quot;You know I never want you to go.&quot;
&quot;Well, you did say that as if you meant it.&quot;
&quot;Thanks for the few flowers,&quot; said Laurie, unable to prevent himself.
&quot;You never do take me seriously, do you?&quot;
Laurie never, perhaps, came nearer to a disastrous self-betrayal than in that moment of almost pure exasperation. It passed, and he perceived that Andrew was almost rigid with embarrassment, as people are who realize that they have let something slip out. &quot;That was only a joke,&quot; he added, with the fatal error of timing that destroys all credibility.
&quot;Try sending it to the New Yorker. It's too sophisticated for Punch.&quot; There was pause.
&quot;Sorry. You were better off with a good book.&quot;
&quot;Andrew.&quot; There was silence. &quot;Look - what is the matter?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; He had been staring before him, his arms around his knees; suddenly he scrambled to his feel. &quot;I think I'll go back to bed. I don't seem fit to be with anyone. Thanks for putting up with me, but I don't see why you should have to. I don't know what's come over me, to make me behave like this.&quot;
&quot;Sit down,&quot; said Laurie. He had suppressed just in time the hopeless attempt to jump up too. Andrew sat down again: he picked a long, tough stem of grass and pulled it apart. Laurie said, &quot;You want some sleep, that's all.&quot; He looked down unseeingly at the book he was still holding. &quot;You're not in half as filthy a mood as I always am if I miss a night.&quot;
&quot;Do you often?&quot;
&quot;Not me, I always shout for dope.&quot;
Andrew made an irresolute movement, as if to go after all. Perhaps it's better, Laurie thought.
&quot;What were you reading before I interrupted you? Can I see?&quot;
Laurie kept his hand on the book covering the title. In his imagination he pages were printed not with their own paragraphsonly, but with all that he himself had brought to them: it seemed as though he must be identified and revealed in them, beyond all pretense of detachment, as if they were a diary to which he had committed every secret of his heart.
Andrew moved back looking awkward and constrained, and Laurie suddenly wondered whether he supposed it was something pornographic; after all in a free country there are very few reasons for hiding books. He tossed it over.
Andrew picked it up and said, &quot;I haven't read this one. I thought it was Phaedo for a minute, we did that at school. What's it about?&quot;
Laurie remembered in the nick of time to say, &quot;Well, primarily, it's about the laws of rhetoric.&quot;
&quot;Are you interested in rhetoric? If I were asked to choose the least likely person I could think of, it would be you.&quot;
&quot;Actually I suppose people read it most for the sample speeches.&quot; Andrew waited expectantly. Laurie felt the held-in feeling in his chest easing off. &quot;There are three, but the first is rather a dull one, just put up to be knocked down. Socrates recomposes it as he thinks it ought to be done. Then he decides it ought not to be done at all because it isn't true. So he does another of his own on the same subject.&quot;
&quot;What subject?&quot;
&quot;Love.&quot; Laurie skimmed as lightly as he could over the most treacherous word in the language. &quot;The first speech sets out to prove that a lover who isn't in love is preferably to one who is. Being less jealous, easier to live with, and generally more civilized.&quot;
&quot;It sounds,&quot; said Andrew with the maddening intolerance of youth, &quot;hardly worth stating the first time, let alone redoing it.&quot;
&quot;Well, maybe, but Socrates' version is quite amusing. And, as a matter of fat, perfectly true. Only as the whole thing hangs on the definition of love, he's able to turn it inside out in the refutation, which is the highlight of the piece. It ----&quot;
&quot;Read it to me.&quot;
&quot;What? Oh, no. No, I ----&quot; It was a moment before he recovered the presence of mind to add, &quot;It's far too long.&quot;
&quot;Read as much as you can, then.&quot; Andrew lay down on the grass. It could be seen that he was very tired. His voice had the edgy insistence one hears in a child's who has sat up too long.
&quot;No, I should spoit it.&quot; It and much more, he thought. To keep Andrew quiet he went on, &quot;It's got the famous myth of the charioteer.&quot;
&quot;I don't know it. Go on.&quot;
&quot;Well ...&quot; He paused. It had been part of his mind's furniture for years, but he had never spoken of it to anyone before. &quot;He likens the soul to a charioteer, driving two winged horses harnessed abreast.&quot;
&quot;Yes, don't stop.&quot;
&quot;Each of the gods has a pair of divine white horses, but the soul only has one. The other&quot; (he smiled to himself; he always remembered this part best) &quot;is black and scruffy, with a thick neck, a fla face, hairy fetlocks, gray bloodshot eyes, and shaggy ears. He's hard of hearing, thick-skinned, and given to bolting whenever he sees something he wants. So the two beasts rarely see eye to eye, but the charioteer has to keep them on the road together. The god driving his well-matched grays is ahead setting the pace; he drives up to a track which encirlces the heavens, and is carried around with eternity as it spins, like ----&quot;
Andrew, interrupting, said, &quot;'Like a great ring of pure and endless light.'&quot;
&quot;Yes. Yes, that will be where Vaughan got it, I suppose.&quot; Both found themselves with nothing to say. And now, thought Laurie, he will ask at any moment, &quot;But what has all this to do with love?&quot;
In fact, however, he said nothing, but picked up the book itself from the grass, where Laurie had forgotten it. Presently he said without turning around, &quot;You've had this for quite a time, have't you?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I had it at school.&quot;
&quot;And you took it to France with you.&quot;
&quot;All too obviously, I'm afraid. I must get it rebound.&quot;
&quot;I should like to read it. Willyou lend it me?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Of course. I'll let you have it sometime. I'll try and clean it first, or put on a paper cover or somehting. It's really in too filthy a condition to pass around.&quot;
Andrew said, his usually clear voice muffled by the position he was lying in, &quot;You needn't for me.&quot;
Laurie knew that at this point he should not have allowed another silence to begin. The rustle of a rabbit in the wood echoed like the tread of cattle; the faint sound of a page turning seemed to go through his skin like a cutting edge.
After all it was Andrew who was the first to speak.
&quot;Ralph Ross Lanyon.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; said Laurie stupidly.
&quot;It's the name that's written in the book, before yours.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I know, what about it?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. I only thought, perhaps, it was a present from someone.&quot;
Laurie reached for a cigarette. &quot;What a romantic mind you have,&quot; he said from behind his hands. &quot;It came down to me from a chap who was leaving, that's all.&quot;
&quot;I only meant,&quot; said Andrew stiffly, &quot;that if it's a book you'd rather not lend, or anything, it doesn't matter. I should quite understand.&quot;
he coaxed the cigarette alight, carefully. &quot;Just for the record, I've neither seen nor heared anything of Lanyon since the day he left; if I saw him again I probably wouldn't know him, and it's even less likely that he'd know me.&quot; He broke off with a vague feeling that he had said more than enough. &quot;Does that cover everything?&quot;
&quot;It should, shouldn't it? A lot of people would just have told me to mind my own business. Don't take any more notice of me.&quot; he put the book down, and burrowed his head into his arm as if to sleep. Laurie sat waiting: longing wearily, yet dreading, to be released into loneliness by the coming of this little death. But Andrew's breathing was quick and silent. He turned and looked up. &quot;I wonder ---- are you very short of cigarettes, could you spare me one?&quot;
&quot;Sorry, I thought you didn't smoke.&quot;
&quot;I don't really. I just felt like it. If you're sure you've enought.&quot; He didn't move back when he had taken it. &quot;I haven't a match; give me lgith from yours.&quot; He leaned up on his elbow; his tilted head caught a splinter of light from between the branches. One of the gold birch leaves had fallen in his hair.
Laurie drew on the cigarette; a bright ring ran swiftly up the paper. He watched it burn for a moment; turned and began to lean down; then took the cigarette quickly and handed it at arms' length length across. &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Andrew. He got his cigarette lighted, gave Laurie's back to him, and turned away. Neither spoke; the faint curls of smoke looked blue against the shadows of the wood behind them.
After a few minutes Andrew stubbed out his cigarette and said, &quot;I think I shall sleep here. It's quieter than the hut. Do you mind?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Laurie. &quot;I can't think of any objection.&quot;
&quot;I shan't oversleep, so don't bother about me. Just go when you have to go. You won't need to go yet, will you?&quot;
&quot;No. I shan't be going yet.&quot;
&quot;Just forget about me. You looked so peaceful before I came disturbing you. Now you can get on with your book as if I weren't here.&quot;</q></blockquote> <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>从这里表现出Laurie很珍惜学长送的书啊，连心头好Andrew都不舍得借。看来从潜意识里，Laurie已经有取舍了。

Lanyon was sitting in his armchair, doing something with a penknife to propelling pencil. He looked up. He was slight and lean, with dusty-fair hair and eyes of a striking light blue which were narrowed by the structure of the orbit above, giving him a searching look even when he smiled. He wasn't smiling.
&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Odell. Shut the door.&quot;
Laurie shut it, feeling sick in the pit of his stomach, and waited. The length of the wait was always proportioned to the offense; but he was past measuring time. Lanyon made some further adjustment of the pencil, screwed down the lead, shut the knife and put it in his pocket. As always he was extremely neat, his hair brushed and recently trimmed, his shirt looking as if he had just put it on. He had spent last year's summer holidays working his passage to Iceland and back in a trawler, and had recently been accepted for a projected research expedition to the Arctic. The biggest toughs in the School, when stood against Lanyon, looked muscle-bound or run to seed. Lines of decision showed around his eyes and mouth; at nine-teen, he was marked already with the bleak courage of the self-disciplined neurotic. Laurie, who was in no state to be analytical, only thought that Lanyon looked more than usually like chilled steel. Suddenly it seemed certain that the prevailing rumor had got garbled in transit, and almost certainly didn't even refer to Lanyon at all. Laurie waited as if at the stake, clenching his lower jaw.
Having disposed of the penknife, Lanyon looked up again. His light eyes raked Laurie, coldly, from head to foot.

                <blockquote><q>The sun slanted deep into the wood, making hidden birds sing softly. The touch of autumn struck from his youth that cosmic sadness, which time will tame like the bite of spring. Under the pale sun, beauty and fate and love and death ached through him. After a while he sighed, and took out his book.
He found that the sea water hadn't soaked in beyond the notes at the back. The front cover unfortunately recalled the butcher's order book which his mother used to keep, fastidiously, apart from the others; but though the tops of the pages were stained, they parted easily, and inside they were clean. He turned them to and fro, remembering other places where he had read them: in a punt moored to a wilow by Magdalen Bridge, on a packing-case behind a Nissen hut; and the first time of all, in a sunny clearing with a stream running through it, a short way from his home. It had struck him with religious awe to find Phaedrus leading Socrates almost, it might have bee, to the very spot. The spreading tree, the green bank to lean on, the water cold to the foot: nothing had been wanting, except the votive offerings and the shrine. &quot;Give me to be beautiful within,&quot; Socrates had prayed, &quot;and for me let outward and inward things be reconciled together.&quot;
Laurie turned the pages gently; they separately at the top with a crisp little sound. He found the part he was looking for and smoothed it open.
... and so it is with the followers of the other gods. Each man in his life honors, and imitates as well as he can, that god to whose choir he belonged, while he is uncorrupted in his first incarnation here; and in the fashion he has thus learned, he bears himself to his beloved as well as to the rest. So, then, each chooses from among the beautiful a love conforming to his kind; and then, as if his chosen were his god, he sets him up and robes him for worship. ...
Laurie looked up at the barley; if any of the beautiful and ruthless Olympians had owned him they had lost him, he thought.
... and this striving to discover the essence of their proper god, by tracing him in themselves, is rewarded; for they are force to look on the god without flinching, and when their memory holds him, his breath inspires them, and they share his attributes and his life, as far as man can enter godhead. And for these blessings they thank the loved one, loving him even more dearly. ...
Laurie put down the book and folded his arms behind his head. He was not analytical enough yet to have discovered that there are certain loves, and certain phases of love, which bring perfect happiness only in their pauses and internals, as water grows clear when one's progress has ceased to stir it.
... and it fills the soul of the beloved also ...
As he read on, a cock pheasant made easy by his stillness came picking within a few yards of his feet.
He is in love, therefore, but with whom he cannot say; he does not know what has become of him, he cannot tell. He sees himself in ...
The pheasant, startled, burst up almost into Laurie's face and whirred away; but he scarcely noticed it.
... he sees himself in his lover as if in a mirror, not knowing whom he sees. And when they are together, he too is released from pain, and when apart, he longs as he himself is longed for; for reflected in his heart is love's image, which is love's answer. But he calls it, and believes it, not love but friendship; though he too ----
&quot;That book must be good,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;What is it?&quot;
Laurie felt his heart jerk like a shot deer. An uncontrollable reflex, as he sat up, made him slap the book shut and lean his hand on it.
&quot;Good Lord, Andrew,&quot; he said breathlessly, &quot;you made me jump half out of my skin.&quot;
Andrew came out of the wood behind him, from the footpath he had forgotten.
&quot;Well, I needed that to make me believe you weren't cutting me on purpose. You looked too absorbed to be true.&quot;
Something in his voice made Laurie look up at him. His air of ease had not come easily; he was acting; it surprised Laurie to see that he could do it so well. More, he looked tired; for the first time since he had gone on night duty there were dark smears under his eyes.
&quot;Sit down, you're giving me a crick in the neck.&quot; Straining not to betray himself or to sound unwelcoming, Laurie could feel himself striking a note of appalling heartiness, like a housemaster on sports day. &quot;What a desperate character you are, turning day into night like this. It's only ten to three. What happened?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Andrew sat down on the grass beside him. &quot;I felt like a walk.&quot;
&quot;If I'd known I'd have waited for you. How did you know where to look?&quot;
&quot;I asked Reg Barker, of course. I always do.&quot;
&quot;Do you?&quot; He did not add that Reg had never mentioned it. &quot;Have some blackberries.&quot; He had picked a leafful on the way.
Andrew ate one and, turning the next one over, said, &quot;I thought you might - I mean, if you'd rather be on your own do tell me. Honestly, I shall quite ----&quot;
The lovers of the innocent must protect them above all from the knowledge of their own cruelty. &quot;You know I never want you to go.&quot;
&quot;Well, you did say that as if you meant it.&quot;
&quot;Thanks for the few flowers,&quot; said Laurie, unable to prevent himself.
&quot;You never do take me seriously, do you?&quot;
Laurie never, perhaps, came nearer to a disastrous self-betrayal than in that moment of almost pure exasperation. It passed, and he perceived that Andrew was almost rigid with embarrassment, as people are who realize that they have let something slip out. &quot;That was only a joke,&quot; he added, with the fatal error of timing that destroys all credibility.
&quot;Try sending it to the New Yorker. It's too sophisticated for Punch.&quot; There was pause.
&quot;Sorry. You were better off with a good book.&quot;
&quot;Andrew.&quot; There was silence. &quot;Look - what is the matter?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; He had been staring before him, his arms around his knees; suddenly he scrambled to his feel. &quot;I think I'll go back to bed. I don't seem fit to be with anyone. Thanks for putting up with me, but I don't see why you should have to. I don't know what's come over me, to make me behave like this.&quot;
&quot;Sit down,&quot; said Laurie. He had suppressed just in time the hopeless attempt to jump up too. Andrew sat down again: he picked a long, tough stem of grass and pulled it apart. Laurie said, &quot;You want some sleep, that's all.&quot; He looked down unseeingly at the book he was still holding. &quot;You're not in half as filthy a mood as I always am if I miss a night.&quot;
&quot;Do you often?&quot;
&quot;Not me, I always shout for dope.&quot;
Andrew made an irresolute movement, as if to go after all. Perhaps it's better, Laurie thought.
&quot;What were you reading before I interrupted you? Can I see?&quot;
Laurie kept his hand on the book covering the title. In his imagination he pages were printed not with their own paragraphsonly, but with all that he himself had brought to them: it seemed as though he must be identified and revealed in them, beyond all pretense of detachment, as if they were a diary to which he had committed every secret of his heart.
Andrew moved back looking awkward and constrained, and Laurie suddenly wondered whether he supposed it was something pornographic; after all in a free country there are very few reasons for hiding books. He tossed it over.
Andrew picked it up and said, &quot;I haven't read this one. I thought it was Phaedo for a minute, we did that at school. What's it about?&quot;
Laurie remembered in the nick of time to say, &quot;Well, primarily, it's about the laws of rhetoric.&quot;
&quot;Are you interested in rhetoric? If I were asked to choose the least likely person I could think of, it would be you.&quot;
&quot;Actually I suppose people read it most for the sample speeches.&quot; Andrew waited expectantly. Laurie felt the held-in feeling in his chest easing off. &quot;There are three, but the first is rather a dull one, just put up to be knocked down. Socrates recomposes it as he thinks it ought to be done. Then he decides it ought not to be done at all because it isn't true. So he does another of his own on the same subject.&quot;
&quot;What subject?&quot;
&quot;Love.&quot; Laurie skimmed as lightly as he could over the most treacherous word in the language. &quot;The first speech sets out to prove that a lover who isn't in love is preferably to one who is. Being less jealous, easier to live with, and generally more civilized.&quot;
&quot;It sounds,&quot; said Andrew with the maddening intolerance of youth, &quot;hardly worth stating the first time, let alone redoing it.&quot;
&quot;Well, maybe, but Socrates' version is quite amusing. And, as a matter of fat, perfectly true. Only as the whole thing hangs on the definition of love, he's able to turn it inside out in the refutation, which is the highlight of the piece. It ----&quot;
&quot;Read it to me.&quot;
&quot;What? Oh, no. No, I ----&quot; It was a moment before he recovered the presence of mind to add, &quot;It's far too long.&quot;
&quot;Read as much as you can, then.&quot; Andrew lay down on the grass. It could be seen that he was very tired. His voice had the edgy insistence one hears in a child's who has sat up too long.
&quot;No, I should spoit it.&quot; It and much more, he thought. To keep Andrew quiet he went on, &quot;It's got the famous myth of the charioteer.&quot;
&quot;I don't know it. Go on.&quot;
&quot;Well ...&quot; He paused. It had been part of his mind's furniture for years, but he had never spoken of it to anyone before. &quot;He likens the soul to a charioteer, driving two winged horses harnessed abreast.&quot;
&quot;Yes, don't stop.&quot;
&quot;Each of the gods has a pair of divine white horses, but the soul only has one. The other&quot; (he smiled to himself; he always remembered this part best) &quot;is black and scruffy, with a thick neck, a fla face, hairy fetlocks, gray bloodshot eyes, and shaggy ears. He's hard of hearing, thick-skinned, and given to bolting whenever he sees something he wants. So the two beasts rarely see eye to eye, but the charioteer has to keep them on the road together. The god driving his well-matched grays is ahead setting the pace; he drives up to a track which encirlces the heavens, and is carried around with eternity as it spins, like ----&quot;
Andrew, interrupting, said, &quot;'Like a great ring of pure and endless light.'&quot;
&quot;Yes. Yes, that will be where Vaughan got it, I suppose.&quot; Both found themselves with nothing to say. And now, thought Laurie, he will ask at any moment, &quot;But what has all this to do with love?&quot;
In fact, however, he said nothing, but picked up the book itself from the grass, where Laurie had forgotten it. Presently he said without turning around, &quot;You've had this for quite a time, have't you?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I had it at school.&quot;
&quot;And you took it to France with you.&quot;
&quot;All too obviously, I'm afraid. I must get it rebound.&quot;
&quot;I should like to read it. Willyou lend it me?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Of course. I'll let you have it sometime. I'll try and clean it first, or put on a paper cover or somehting. It's really in too filthy a condition to pass around.&quot;
Andrew said, his usually clear voice muffled by the position he was lying in, &quot;You needn't for me.&quot;
Laurie knew that at this point he should not have allowed another silence to begin. The rustle of a rabbit in the wood echoed like the tread of cattle; the faint sound of a page turning seemed to go through his skin like a cutting edge.
After all it was Andrew who was the first to speak.
&quot;Ralph Ross Lanyon.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; said Laurie stupidly.
&quot;It's the name that's written in the book, before yours.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I know, what about it?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. I only thought, perhaps, it was a present from someone.&quot;
Laurie reached for a cigarette. &quot;What a romantic mind you have,&quot; he said from behind his hands. &quot;It came down to me from a chap who was leaving, that's all.&quot;
&quot;I only meant,&quot; said Andrew stiffly, &quot;that if it's a book you'd rather not lend, or anything, it doesn't matter. I should quite understand.&quot;
he coaxed the cigarette alight, carefully. &quot;Just for the record, I've neither seen nor heared anything of Lanyon since the day he left; if I saw him again I probably wouldn't know him, and it's even less likely that he'd know me.&quot; He broke off with a vague feeling that he had said more than enough. &quot;Does that cover everything?&quot;
&quot;It should, shouldn't it? A lot of people would just have told me to mind my own business. Don't take any more notice of me.&quot; he put the book down, and burrowed his head into his arm as if to sleep. Laurie sat waiting: longing wearily, yet dreading, to be released into loneliness by the coming of this little death. But Andrew's breathing was quick and silent. He turned and looked up. &quot;I wonder ---- are you very short of cigarettes, could you spare me one?&quot;
&quot;Sorry, I thought you didn't smoke.&quot;
&quot;I don't really. I just felt like it. If you're sure you've enought.&quot; He didn't move back when he had taken it. &quot;I haven't a match; give me lgith from yours.&quot; He leaned up on his elbow; his tilted head caught a splinter of light from between the branches. One of the gold birch leaves had fallen in his hair.
Laurie drew on the cigarette; a bright ring ran swiftly up the paper. He watched it burn for a moment; turned and began to lean down; then took the cigarette quickly and handed it at arms' length length across. &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Andrew. He got his cigarette lighted, gave Laurie's back to him, and turned away. Neither spoke; the faint curls of smoke looked blue against the shadows of the wood behind them.
After a few minutes Andrew stubbed out his cigarette and said, &quot;I think I shall sleep here. It's quieter than the hut. Do you mind?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Laurie. &quot;I can't think of any objection.&quot;
&quot;I shan't oversleep, so don't bother about me. Just go when you have to go. You won't need to go yet, will you?&quot;
&quot;No. I shan't be going yet.&quot;
&quot;Just forget about me. You looked so peaceful before I came disturbing you. Now you can get on with your book as if I weren't here.&quot;</q></blockquote> <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>从这里表现出Laurie很珍惜学长送的书啊，连心头好Andrew都不舍得借。看来从潜意识里，Laurie已经有取舍了。

                <blockquote><q>The sun slanted deep into the wood, making hidden birds sing softly. The touch of autumn struck from his youth that cosmic sadness, which time will tame like the bite of spring. Under the pale sun, beauty and fate and love and death ached through him. After a while he sighed, and took out his book.
He found that the sea water hadn't soaked in beyond the notes at the back. The front cover unfortunately recalled the butcher's order book which his mother used to keep, fastidiously, apart from the others; but though the tops of the pages were stained, they parted easily, and inside they were clean. He turned them to and fro, remembering other places where he had read them: in a punt moored to a wilow by Magdalen Bridge, on a packing-case behind a Nissen hut; and the first time of all, in a sunny clearing with a stream running through it, a short way from his home. It had struck him with religious awe to find Phaedrus leading Socrates almost, it might have bee, to the very spot. The spreading tree, the green bank to lean on, the water cold to the foot: nothing had been wanting, except the votive offerings and the shrine. &quot;Give me to be beautiful within,&quot; Socrates had prayed, &quot;and for me let outward and inward things be reconciled together.&quot;
Laurie turned the pages gently; they separately at the top with a crisp little sound. He found the part he was looking for and smoothed it open.
... and so it is with the followers of the other gods. Each man in his life honors, and imitates as well as he can, that god to whose choir he belonged, while he is uncorrupted in his first incarnation here; and in the fashion he has thus learned, he bears himself to his beloved as well as to the rest. So, then, each chooses from among the beautiful a love conforming to his kind; and then, as if his chosen were his god, he sets him up and robes him for worship. ...
Laurie looked up at the barley; if any of the beautiful and ruthless Olympians had owned him they had lost him, he thought.
... and this striving to discover the essence of their proper god, by tracing him in themselves, is rewarded; for they are force to look on the god without flinching, and when their memory holds him, his breath inspires them, and they share his attributes and his life, as far as man can enter godhead. And for these blessings they thank the loved one, loving him even more dearly. ...
Laurie put down the book and folded his arms behind his head. He was not analytical enough yet to have discovered that there are certain loves, and certain phases of love, which bring perfect happiness only in their pauses and internals, as water grows clear when one's progress has ceased to stir it.
... and it fills the soul of the beloved also ...
As he read on, a cock pheasant made easy by his stillness came picking within a few yards of his feet.
He is in love, therefore, but with whom he cannot say; he does not know what has become of him, he cannot tell. He sees himself in ...
The pheasant, startled, burst up almost into Laurie's face and whirred away; but he scarcely noticed it.
... he sees himself in his lover as if in a mirror, not knowing whom he sees. And when they are together, he too is released from pain, and when apart, he longs as he himself is longed for; for reflected in his heart is love's image, which is love's answer. But he calls it, and believes it, not love but friendship; though he too ----
&quot;That book must be good,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;What is it?&quot;
Laurie felt his heart jerk like a shot deer. An uncontrollable reflex, as he sat up, made him slap the book shut and lean his hand on it.
&quot;Good Lord, Andrew,&quot; he said breathlessly, &quot;you made me jump half out of my skin.&quot;
Andrew came out of the wood behind him, from the footpath he had forgotten.
&quot;Well, I needed that to make me believe you weren't cutting me on purpose. You looked too absorbed to be true.&quot;
Something in his voice made Laurie look up at him. His air of ease had not come easily; he was acting; it surprised Laurie to see that he could do it so well. More, he looked tired; for the first time since he had gone on night duty there were dark smears under his eyes.
&quot;Sit down, you're giving me a crick in the neck.&quot; Straining not to betray himself or to sound unwelcoming, Laurie could feel himself striking a note of appalling heartiness, like a housemaster on sports day. &quot;What a desperate character you are, turning day into night like this. It's only ten to three. What happened?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Andrew sat down on the grass beside him. &quot;I felt like a walk.&quot;
&quot;If I'd known I'd have waited for you. How did you know where to look?&quot;
&quot;I asked Reg Barker, of course. I always do.&quot;
&quot;Do you?&quot; He did not add that Reg had never mentioned it. &quot;Have some blackberries.&quot; He had picked a leafful on the way.
Andrew ate one and, turning the next one over, said, &quot;I thought you might - I mean, if you'd rather be on your own do tell me. Honestly, I shall quite ----&quot;
The lovers of the innocent must protect them above all from the knowledge of their own cruelty. &quot;You know I never want you to go.&quot;
&quot;Well, you did say that as if you meant it.&quot;
&quot;Thanks for the few flowers,&quot; said Laurie, unable to prevent himself.
&quot;You never do take me seriously, do you?&quot;
Laurie never, perhaps, came nearer to a disastrous self-betrayal than in that moment of almost pure exasperation. It passed, and he perceived that Andrew was almost rigid with embarrassment, as people are who realize that they have let something slip out. &quot;That was only a joke,&quot; he added, with the fatal error of timing that destroys all credibility.
&quot;Try sending it to the New Yorker. It's too sophisticated for Punch.&quot; There was pause.
&quot;Sorry. You were better off with a good book.&quot;
&quot;Andrew.&quot; There was silence. &quot;Look - what is the matter?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; He had been staring before him, his arms around his knees; suddenly he scrambled to his feel. &quot;I think I'll go back to bed. I don't seem fit to be with anyone. Thanks for putting up with me, but I don't see why you should have to. I don't know what's come over me, to make me behave like this.&quot;
&quot;Sit down,&quot; said Laurie. He had suppressed just in time the hopeless attempt to jump up too. Andrew sat down again: he picked a long, tough stem of grass and pulled it apart. Laurie said, &quot;You want some sleep, that's all.&quot; He looked down unseeingly at the book he was still holding. &quot;You're not in half as filthy a mood as I always am if I miss a night.&quot;
&quot;Do you often?&quot;
&quot;Not me, I always shout for dope.&quot;
Andrew made an irresolute movement, as if to go after all. Perhaps it's better, Laurie thought.
&quot;What were you reading before I interrupted you? Can I see?&quot;
Laurie kept his hand on the book covering the title. In his imagination he pages were printed not with their own paragraphsonly, but with all that he himself had brought to them: it seemed as though he must be identified and revealed in them, beyond all pretense of detachment, as if they were a diary to which he had committed every secret of his heart.
Andrew moved back looking awkward and constrained, and Laurie suddenly wondered whether he supposed it was something pornographic; after all in a free country there are very few reasons for hiding books. He tossed it over.
Andrew picked it up and said, &quot;I haven't read this one. I thought it was Phaedo for a minute, we did that at school. What's it about?&quot;
Laurie remembered in the nick of time to say, &quot;Well, primarily, it's about the laws of rhetoric.&quot;
&quot;Are you interested in rhetoric? If I were asked to choose the least likely person I could think of, it would be you.&quot;
&quot;Actually I suppose people read it most for the sample speeches.&quot; Andrew waited expectantly. Laurie felt the held-in feeling in his chest easing off. &quot;There are three, but the first is rather a dull one, just put up to be knocked down. Socrates recomposes it as he thinks it ought to be done. Then he decides it ought not to be done at all because it isn't true. So he does another of his own on the same subject.&quot;
&quot;What subject?&quot;
&quot;Love.&quot; Laurie skimmed as lightly as he could over the most treacherous word in the language. &quot;The first speech sets out to prove that a lover who isn't in love is preferably to one who is. Being less jealous, easier to live with, and generally more civilized.&quot;
&quot;It sounds,&quot; said Andrew with the maddening intolerance of youth, &quot;hardly worth stating the first time, let alone redoing it.&quot;
&quot;Well, maybe, but Socrates' version is quite amusing. And, as a matter of fat, perfectly true. Only as the whole thing hangs on the definition of love, he's able to turn it inside out in the refutation, which is the highlight of the piece. It ----&quot;
&quot;Read it to me.&quot;
&quot;What? Oh, no. No, I ----&quot; It was a moment before he recovered the presence of mind to add, &quot;It's far too long.&quot;
&quot;Read as much as you can, then.&quot; Andrew lay down on the grass. It could be seen that he was very tired. His voice had the edgy insistence one hears in a child's who has sat up too long.
&quot;No, I should spoit it.&quot; It and much more, he thought. To keep Andrew quiet he went on, &quot;It's got the famous myth of the charioteer.&quot;
&quot;I don't know it. Go on.&quot;
&quot;Well ...&quot; He paused. It had been part of his mind's furniture for years, but he had never spoken of it to anyone before. &quot;He likens the soul to a charioteer, driving two winged horses harnessed abreast.&quot;
&quot;Yes, don't stop.&quot;
&quot;Each of the gods has a pair of divine white horses, but the soul only has one. The other&quot; (he smiled to himself; he always remembered this part best) &quot;is black and scruffy, with a thick neck, a fla face, hairy fetlocks, gray bloodshot eyes, and shaggy ears. He's hard of hearing, thick-skinned, and given to bolting whenever he sees something he wants. So the two beasts rarely see eye to eye, but the charioteer has to keep them on the road together. The god driving his well-matched grays is ahead setting the pace; he drives up to a track which encirlces the heavens, and is carried around with eternity as it spins, like ----&quot;
Andrew, interrupting, said, &quot;'Like a great ring of pure and endless light.'&quot;
&quot;Yes. Yes, that will be where Vaughan got it, I suppose.&quot; Both found themselves with nothing to say. And now, thought Laurie, he will ask at any moment, &quot;But what has all this to do with love?&quot;
In fact, however, he said nothing, but picked up the book itself from the grass, where Laurie had forgotten it. Presently he said without turning around, &quot;You've had this for quite a time, have't you?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I had it at school.&quot;
&quot;And you took it to France with you.&quot;
&quot;All too obviously, I'm afraid. I must get it rebound.&quot;
&quot;I should like to read it. Willyou lend it me?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Of course. I'll let you have it sometime. I'll try and clean it first, or put on a paper cover or somehting. It's really in too filthy a condition to pass around.&quot;
Andrew said, his usually clear voice muffled by the position he was lying in, &quot;You needn't for me.&quot;
Laurie knew that at this point he should not have allowed another silence to begin. The rustle of a rabbit in the wood echoed like the tread of cattle; the faint sound of a page turning seemed to go through his skin like a cutting edge.
After all it was Andrew who was the first to speak.
&quot;Ralph Ross Lanyon.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; said Laurie stupidly.
&quot;It's the name that's written in the book, before yours.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I know, what about it?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. I only thought, perhaps, it was a present from someone.&quot;
Laurie reached for a cigarette. &quot;What a romantic mind you have,&quot; he said from behind his hands. &quot;It came down to me from a chap who was leaving, that's all.&quot;
&quot;I only meant,&quot; said Andrew stiffly, &quot;that if it's a book you'd rather not lend, or anything, it doesn't matter. I should quite understand.&quot;
he coaxed the cigarette alight, carefully. &quot;Just for the record, I've neither seen nor heared anything of Lanyon since the day he left; if I saw him again I probably wouldn't know him, and it's even less likely that he'd know me.&quot; He broke off with a vague feeling that he had said more than enough. &quot;Does that cover everything?&quot;
&quot;It should, shouldn't it? A lot of people would just have told me to mind my own business. Don't take any more notice of me.&quot; he put the book down, and burrowed his head into his arm as if to sleep. Laurie sat waiting: longing wearily, yet dreading, to be released into loneliness by the coming of this little death. But Andrew's breathing was quick and silent. He turned and looked up. &quot;I wonder ---- are you very short of cigarettes, could you spare me one?&quot;
&quot;Sorry, I thought you didn't smoke.&quot;
&quot;I don't really. I just felt like it. If you're sure you've enought.&quot; He didn't move back when he had taken it. &quot;I haven't a match; give me lgith from yours.&quot; He leaned up on his elbow; his tilted head caught a splinter of light from between the branches. One of the gold birch leaves had fallen in his hair.
Laurie drew on the cigarette; a bright ring ran swiftly up the paper. He watched it burn for a moment; turned and began to lean down; then took the cigarette quickly and handed it at arms' length length across. &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Andrew. He got his cigarette lighted, gave Laurie's back to him, and turned away. Neither spoke; the faint curls of smoke looked blue against the shadows of the wood behind them.
After a few minutes Andrew stubbed out his cigarette and said, &quot;I think I shall sleep here. It's quieter than the hut. Do you mind?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Laurie. &quot;I can't think of any objection.&quot;
&quot;I shan't oversleep, so don't bother about me. Just go when you have to go. You won't need to go yet, will you?&quot;
&quot;No. I shan't be going yet.&quot;
&quot;Just forget about me. You looked so peaceful before I came disturbing you. Now you can get on with your book as if I weren't here.&quot;</q></blockquote> <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>从这里表现出Laurie很珍惜学长送的书啊，连心头好Andrew都不舍得借。看来从潜意识里，Laurie已经有取舍了。

Even the day's disaster withdrew into a distance where it was known rather than felt. All the tangles of his life seemed looser and easier to resolve. He didn't want to take his mind from the story, or disturb with analysis this fragile happiness and security, which were what one might feel if some legend, dear to one's childhood but long abandoned, were marvellously proved true.
&quot;... these big ocean-going dhows that come over from Arabia with the monsoon. They have a high carved poop like a caravel, and a raked-up bowsprit. There were a lot of them coming into the Old Harbor the way they do, covered in tassels and pennants with the crews singing and dancing on the decks, and beating drums and gongs. Just after we'd passed them ...&quot;
The strange feeling of fulfillment touched Laurie again; suddenly he remembered and understood. In the weeks of summer holiday seven years before, after he had read the Phaedrus by the stream in the wood, he had gone for long walks alone, and, returning, sat n the evening by a September fire, so silent and enclosed that more than once his mother had asked if he was well. It was of this that he had been dreaming.
Involuntarily he moved his hands so that they covered his face, as the dream came back in all the high colors of boyhood: his own room with the fire he had, as a rule, only on the first day of the holidays, furnished as he had thought, then, he would want it when he was older; the flickering light on leather and books; and Ralph's face at nineteen. In the dream there had always been a pause in which he had looked up and said, &quot;Next time you go away, I'm going with you&quot;; and Ralph, who hadn't had a first name in those days, had looked down all the same and answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;</q></blockquote>

It's gonna be a long process so please don't ask me how much I still have to do. All of it. A year may not be enough. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Please help me if you can. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The first questions: <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>1. Which EDITION should I choose to translate? The 53 edition is the original, uncensored one, so I guess it will be good to translate that version? Just I'm not sure that I'm doing the right thing. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2. SPUD - in my dictionary &quot;Spud&quot; has lots of meanings, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;short&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; among them. Which connotations come to your head first when you hear &quot;Spud&quot;? What should be more characteristic for the person to be called so? Is it more about appearance or traits of character? IIs it obsolete? That would help me choose the right nickname in Russian. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3. A very silly question. How do you pronounce &quot;LAURIE&quot;  - in a french manner, like &quot;Lo-riE&quot; (rhymes with &quot;oh yeah&quot;) (this will be &quot;Лорье&quot;) or &quot;LOri&quot; - rhymes with &quot;sorry&quot;? (--&gt; &quot;Лори&quot;)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greenlady2:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>1. The 1953 edition is the one I own. I've read about the changes made in the later edition, and I don't think they're an immprovement, in most cases. The 53 edition seems more detailed, the later edition tighter, perhaps. It may be easier to translate because of that, however. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2. 'Spud' is a name for potato. It makes me think of someone brown, friendly, dependable and familiar. A combination of appearance and character. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3. Laurie rhymes with 'sorry'.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>fatalit:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Thank you very much! Especially for the &quot;Spud&quot; part - that aspect I didn't even think about. And Ralph... That's unexpected! I'll certainly use some help from a native speaker to transliterate the name.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greenlady2：<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>You're welcome. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>As for the 'Ralph' bit, yeah, that's something to check into. Here in Canada we tend to pronounce it the way Americans do -- the way it's spelled. And I could be wrong about the British way of pronouncing it. That would make a difference if you wanted to be really authentic.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>I'm no expert on &quot;Ralph&quot;, but my impression is that the characters in this book are more or less on the cusp of the transition. That is to say, if they had been born ten or fifteen years earlier, then it would definitely have been &quot;Rafe&quot;. Ten or fifteen years later (and up to the present), then most British people would use the spelling pronunciation, just as people in Canada and the States do.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Which leaves our Ralph in phonetic limbo, I suppose.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Is there a Russian equivalent in terms of the name? Because obviously some of the names simply translate. (Andrew and Alec come to mind as obvious examples.)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Actualy, are there other names of which you are uncertain? A lot of the people are called by nicknames, but some of these are just abbreviations of regular names (e.g. &quot;Sandy&quot;), while others aren't (e.g. &quot;Spud&quot;). Do you need help sorting the names out?<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greenlady2:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>... As I understand it, though I could be wrong, the English pronunciation of 'Ralph' rhymes with chafe, or strafe. As if it were spelled 'Rafe'. I think that's right, but a native English person could maybe enlighten me.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>my_cnnr:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>1) the 53..without a doubt...having come to it after living with the US edition about 30 years, I felt I was reading a new book...the characters are better revealed, the environment is richer...please - the '53!<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>2)greenlady's potato reference is correct, but there's an 'Irish connotation that comes along with it, too, I think...the red hair, his name (which though greerwatson will want to try to thwack me for this should really have been spelled with the apostrophe) - were the prompts for that nickname<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>3)Laurie/sorry...in the 2005 CBC there's a discussion of the pronunciation of Ralph...the decision was that to Ralph's contemporaries would have used a long &quot;a&quot;, rhyming Ralph with &quot;safe&quot;...tonight I'll have a go at finding the links for you<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>In British English a distinction would be made between the vowels in &quot;Laurie&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot;, but it's fairly subtle. (This distinction is not made in American English, which has fewer vowel distinctions when the vowel is followed by &quot;r&quot;.)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        It's more a difference in length, than articulation. &quot;Sorry&quot; has a short vowel, &quot;Laurie&quot; a long one. Both have rounded low back vowels. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Do you know the International Phonetic Alphabet? I could try putting it in terms of those symbols. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>fatalit:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Thanks! It's OK without the phonetic symbols, I was asking just to make sure where the accent is and that there are four sounds. There is only one way to put these four sounds into Russian, and it'll be &quot;Лори&quot; (l-o-r-i)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The word &quot;spud&quot; is a slang term for potato. And here's the Irish connection:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the potato (originally from South America) became a staple of the Irish economy, and the principal food eaten by the peasant farmers. It was the potato blight, which destroyed the crop and led to famine, which resulted in the mass emigration of hundreds of thousands of poor Irish people to North America in the mid to late nineteenth century.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Because the Irish ate potatoes (and poor Irish ate little else), potatoes became strongly associated with Ireland.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Spud—the slang term for potato—therefore became a common nickname for people who were Irish, or part Irish, or seen as having some connection with Ireland.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Now, in Laurie's case, he's half Irish. (His father is clearly an Irishman from the way he speaks. Irish Catholic, actually.)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Of course, the people at school never met his father; but then the name Odell should have had—or maybe once had, or at least might have once had—the common Irish spelling with an apostrophe in it, i.e. the spelling &quot;O'Dell&quot;. (No thwackings, dear. You're right.)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Hence the bit in the second chapter when we are told that Laurie went through a phase of spelling it that way. His mother was thinking of remarrying, so Laurie was identifying with his Irish father—and spelling his name the more usual Irish way as a gesture of solidarity.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>As for the red hair: there are red-haired people who are not from Ireland, and there are plenty of Irish who don't have red hair. But there is no doubt that, per capita, the proportion of the population who is red-haired is higher in Ireland than anywhere else in the world.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        There are different shades of red, from reddish tinted blonde through orangy ginger to reddish brown—and Laurie comes in at the dark end of the spectrum. His hair (like mine) was red-gold in infancy, darkened to copper through his school years, and faded to reddish brown by adulthood. However, it is quite possible that people still called him a redhead even as an adult. It depends on the exact shade: I get called &quot;red&quot;, my mother—whose hair faded further—is simply considered to have had light brown hair.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>        Having said that, though, I should point out that the adult Laurie is never described as red-haired in the book. The most you get is Ralph (at the party) saying that the red tints were brought out when Laurie was very white-faced from blood loss.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>fatalit:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>wow, that's a lot to ponder about. Thank you so much!<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Still I have no idea how to put &quot;Spud&quot; in translation. I might leave it as it is and provide a footnote, or use another slang word for &quot;Irish&quot;. I'd really hate to give the character a name which is different from what MR had impeccably chosen, but this is the drawback of most translated texts... <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Being red-haired myself and speaking Engish with an accent I am often taken for Irish by strangers =)<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>I should think that, for most of Laurie's contemporaries, the strongest connotation of the nickname &quot;Spud&quot; would be &quot;Irish&quot;, even though Laurie's really an Englishman. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>In fact, that's part of the joke—that someone who really has nothing Irish about him (except the coincidence of an Irish-sounding surname and reddish hair) still got the &quot;Irish&quot; nickname.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>If there really is a Russian slang term for &quot;Irishman&quot; (especially if it's something that would be used as a nickname), then that probably would be the most appropriate translation.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>fatalit:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Unfortunately there is no special nickname for Irish in my language, only &quot;Paddy&quot; (from Patrick) used in jokes, but that's just the other name, and it would be crazy to change the nickname so radically. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>The best variand I could find is &quot;Sidhe&quot; - celtic burial mounds and the spirits inhabiting them. In russian it sounds like [sid] and is close to &quot;spud&quot; even phonetically, and has strong associations with Ireland. The only thing is that the associations are more celtic than 20th century Ireland. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>So I'm still in two minds, choosing between Sidhe and leaving Spud as it is, with a footnote. The problem is that [spad] in Russian means &quot;decline&quot;<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Yes, &quot;Paddy&quot; is used for Irishmen here, too—and, of course, Patrick is Laurie's middle name. But, as he doesn't use it (and we only learn it halfway through the book), the connection wouldn't be obvious to the reader.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>&quot;Sidhe&quot; certainly has the Celtic connection, and also a phonetic similarity with &quot;Spud&quot;. The problem, as I see it, is the ghost/burial mound association: quite different from the earthy sensible normality of the potato. As greenlady2 said:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>It makes me think of someone brown, friendly, dependable and familiar. A combination of appearance and character. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>It's very plebeian nickname, &quot;Spud&quot; is. One that you would find at least as often among the working classes. One thing Renault probably intended by giving Laurie that particular nickname was to bring him down to earth, as a contrast to his love of ballet and classical music, so that the reader would identify him with the common man, rather than seeing him as effete. For example, it's hard to imagine a &quot;Spud&quot; affecting the sort of mannerisms that Sandy put on for the party. There's nothing spiritual about &quot;Spud&quot;. It's as common as the potato.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>However, I do see your problem about &quot;decline&quot;. There is nothing dwindling about our Laurie!<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>fatalit:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>It's very plebeian nickname, &quot;Spud&quot; is. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>That's true and stops me from altering it with Sidhe right away. <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>*pacing about* I need something Irish and common, Irish and common... but not the jig and ale! <div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Ah well, for now I'll carry on translating with leaving Spud as is. Maybe some better idea will occur as I proceed.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>greerwatson:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>Definitely the '53!<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>mlygia:<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>In the translation for the Portuguese none of the main characters' names was translated. In the case of Laurie a small footnote was introduced the first time in that &quot; Spud &quot; was mentioned. I think that as the characters and the time in that happens the history are very representative of a certain &quot;British&quot; way of life , that is the best solution.<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://http://fatalit.livejournal.com/6143.html" target="_blank">http://http://fatalit.livejournal.com/6143.html</a><div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>------------------------------------------分割线--------------------------------------------------------<div style="padding-bottom:1em;"></div>做搬运工好辛苦啊^==^
